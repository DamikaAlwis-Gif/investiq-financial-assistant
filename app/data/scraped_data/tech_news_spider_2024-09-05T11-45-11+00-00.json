Gaggles of middle schoolers trolled the local mall, where we would stop into the Apple Store, find an early MacBook Pro, and take dozens of pictures with gaudy Photo Booth filters to post on Facebook. Sometimes, other teens would forget to log out of their accounts, and we would post something like “i just pooped” before signing into our own accounts. This isn’t the case anymore. In 2014, the Pew Research Center estimated that 71% of U.S. teens used Facebook; as of 2022, that percentage dropped to 32% , then slightly increased to 33% last year. Other studies from Edison Research have shown the same trend . Though Meta is reticent to share much demographic information about its user base, the app’s head, Tom Alison, said that there are 40 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada between the ages of 18 and 29. Facebook remained central to my social experiences in high school and college. If you weren’t on Facebook, you wouldn’t get invited to parties, and you wouldn’t know when any student clubs were holding meetings. In the 2010s, deleting Facebook would have been a disaster for my social life. Now if I woke up one day to find that my Facebook account had been deleted, it would be a minor inconvenience. My experience isn’t unique. So, as Meta tries to rekindle the flame between Facebook and socially anxious youths, the company released a blog post Wednesday titled, “ Navigating your 20s with Facebook .” “Your twenties are a decade full of transitions, from graduating college, moving to new cities, starting new jobs and living on your own for the first time. It can be a hectic (and fun) decade, and Facebook is here to help,” the post says. Do twentysomethings read the Facebook blog? (Does anyone other than journalists read the Facebook blog?) If they do, they’ll learn that you can meet new friends in groups like “NYC Brunch Squad” or “People We Meet in Book Club,” a virtual book club with almost 20,000 members. (It’s not necessarily a group for meeting fellow readers, but rather, the title is probably referencing a novel by best-selling romance writer Emily Henry.) Meta’s blog also suggests that in your 20s, you could meet the love of your life on Facebook Dating. I don’t know about that, but then again, I’m a single twentysomething who has never used Facebook Dating, so maybe they have a point. What Facebook does get right about Gen Z is that Facebook Marketplace is the new Craigslist. It’s trendy among young people — whether due to environmental consciousness or budget constraints — to shop secondhand. It will never be the safest decision to meet a stranger online to buy their old couch, but if you can at least view that stranger’s Facebook profile, it could be easier to verify that they’re legit. They might even have mutual friends with you, whereas on Craigslist, you’re staring in the face of a private relay email with no personal information. Facebook marketplace is popular enough that rising Gen Z social app Fizz wants to undercut it. The anonymous, college-centric social platform recently added a marketplace to its app with this idea in mind. “There’s that kind of stigma around, like, if I sell something on Craigslist, I might get kidnapped,” Fizz founder Teddy Solomon told TechCrunch . “And Facebook marketplace … Gen Z is not using Facebook,” he said. As Facebook faded out of style, our social architecture shifted. I find out about concerts in my area through Instagram posts or promotional emails from local venues. My friends send invitations to birthday dinners via Partiful , an SMS-based party-planning app backed by a16z, or they just post kitschy Canva graphics to their Close Friends story. Now 20 years old, Facebook is trying to stay relevant. According to Axios , the platform hosted an event with young creators focused on looking forward to Facebook’s next 20 years. Facebook gave creators pamphlets declaring, “We are not your mom’s Facebook.” Instead, the app described itself as “a hub for all things culturally happening in the platform’s underground.” This feels like a stretch. Then again, Abercrombie, which reigned supreme about 20 years ago, has re-emerged into the zeitgeist, with its stock up 900% . Even Mark Zuckerberg has managed a miraculous rebrand . Maybe one day, Facebook will be cool again, too."},
{"category": "AI", "title": "Short series app My Drama takes on Character.AI with its new AI companions", "date": "2024-09-04", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/short-series-app-my-drama-launching-ai-companions/", "content": "Maybe a lack of AI characters is what Quibi got wrong. At least, that’s what one startup appears to believe. My Drama is a new short series app with more than 30 shows, with a majority of them following a soap opera format in order to hook viewers. The app is now launching an AI-powered chatbot for viewers to get to know the characters in depth, bringing it in closer competition with companies like Character.AI, the a16z-backed chatbot startup. The short drama app was developed by Holywater , a Ukraine-based media tech startup founded by Bogdan Nesvit (CEO) and Anatolii Kasianov (CTO). The parent company also operates a reading app called My Passion , mainly known for its romance titles. Since its launch in April, My Drama has rapidly gained traction, boasting 1 million users and $3 million in revenue. Holywater has a strong track record with its products, generating $90 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) across all its offerings. Believe it or not, the short drama app market has taken off, much to Quibi’s dismay. Recent app store data shows that during the first quarter of 2024, 66 short drama apps ( ReelShort , DramaBox, and more) achieved record revenue of $146 million in global consumer spending, per app intelligence firm Appfigures. Holywater believes My Drama stands out among the increasingly crowded market due to its robust library of IP. Thanks to My Passion’s thousands of books already published on the reading app, My Drama has a wealth of content to adapt into films. Plus, My Passion has an established fanbase that will likely be eager to see their favorite characters come to life. By the end of the year, My Drama plans to release 100 titles. The company’s next bet will introduce AI characters that can interact with viewers, creating an immersive storytelling experience. Upon launch, My Drama users will have the opportunity to engage with two fictional characters: Jaxon, the billionaire love interest from “The Shy Beauty and the Billionaire Beast,” and Hayden, the heir of a formidable mafia family in “Love Captive to a Mafia Boss.” After watching a few chapters of the series, the viewer is prompted to chat with the character. They can also ask the characters to send images. (My Drama doesn’t allow NSFW content.) During a demo shared with TechCrunch, Nesvit and Kasianov walked us through what an interaction with Hayden would look like. The app guides you to build a relationship with him and earn his trust (he is a scary mafia boss, after all). He will quiz you on the events in the series, such as inquiring about the rival gang he is aiming to defeat. At the top of the screen is a meter measuring your ranking on Hayden’s trust meter. The company explains this gamification tactic aims to increase engagement on the platform. The AI companions will also be accessible via a standalone app called My Imagination , which is currently in beta. With the new app, users can have more personalized conversations with the characters. Further down the line, they’ll even be able to create their own characters, which is Character.AI’s specialty. It’s worth noting that the characters Jaxon and Hayden are portrayed by real human actors Nazar Grabar and Bodgan Ruban . At a time when actors are concerned about AI’s impact on the industry, it’s interesting that two actors are willing to give a company permission to use their likeness to be an AI companion. However, it’s somewhat reassuring to know that they’re being fairly compensated for it. According to Holywater, the compensation for being an AI companion can exceed their regular actor salary. Nesvit explained, “The payment system consists of a fixed rate plus additional royalties. Depending on the number of users and the time they spend in the chat, actors can now earn up to $10,000 per month. The more users they attract to the chat, the higher their royalty payment.” The human writers and producers at My Drama leverage AI for some aspects of scriptwriting, localization and voice acting. Notably, the company hires hundreds of actors to film content, all of whom have consented to the use of their likenesses for voice sampling and video generation. My Drama utilizes several AI models, including ElevenLabs, Stable Diffusion, OpenAI and Meta’s Llama 3. As many media companies claim, Holywater emphasizes the time and costs saved through the use of AI. For example, when filming a house fire, the company only spent around $100 using AI to create the video, compared to the approximately $8,000 it would have cost without it. The use of AI enables My Drama to produce content in just one week. “Our goal by the end of the year is to drop the costs to at least 40% by using AI,” said Nesvit. Additionally, the company plans to further iterate on the AI chatbot feature, adding a capability where new scenes appear after users interact with characters, which, in a way, allows them to act as the co-creator for the series. It’ll also launch video and voice chatting capabilities sometime in the future. Character.AI recently introduced the ability for users to voice chat with characters. My Drama is available on the web and on iOS and Android devices. While a few episodes are free to watch, the app puts the majority of the episodes behind a paywall. Users have to purchase one of its coin packs, which range from $2.99 to $19.99 per week, to unlock premium titles, ad-free viewing and early access to content."},

According to Forbes , Breslow sent an email to shareholders thanking them for signing off on the deal. The problem is that many of those investors, including Montauk Ventures and Ash Pournouri, claim they didn’t sign off on anything. Montauk’s founder, Philip Krim, told Forbes he does not support the financing, and Breslow didn’t have his permission to be included in a list of investors that had approved the deal. Meanwhile, BlackRock, along with Hedosophia and Untitled Ventures, reportedly applied for a restraining order in an attempt to “halt” Bolt’s Series F round. The trio claimed through an attorney that Bolt was “coercing its investors by forcing them to choose between paying millions of dollars for new stock or losing most of their existing investment.” Bolt declined TechCrunch’s request for comment."},

The lawsuit concerned the Internet Archive’s National Emergency Library , a program it established at the beginning of the pandemic to allow wider access to some 1.3 million e-books. Previously only able to be checked out one at a time, books were later able to be “borrowed” by many people at once. The publishers, which already had an uneasy relationship with both the Internet Archive and the digital book-lending community in general, sued soon after in June 2020 . The publishers contended that going from single-user borrowing to limitless borrowing essentially turned the system from a notional library into unvarnished piracy. For its part, the Internet Archive asserted that its use of the books fell under the fair use doctrine, and that the removal of limits was done in the public interest. Furthermore, as a nonprofit organization, the Internet Archive could have no pecuniary motivation. The courts disagreed, and in March 2023 found the Internet Archive liable. The nonprofit and the plaintiffs reached an agreement, but the Internet Archive also attempted a long-shot appeal — which was just denied, finding that the original judgment was sound. Legally speaking, it is now essentially a matter of fact that what the Internet Archive did was unlawful. The court ruling is a divisive decision in that the Internet Archive was seen as doing a public good by making these books available at the time, and that overly restricting digital lending may have unintended negative consequences. At the same time it’s also hard not to sympathize with the authors who found their works freely available with no remuneration and little accountability. Wired, which first published the news, has a few statements covering the ground. As for the publishers, they’ve won the case but left few convinced of their arguments. It’s been questioned whether, as with some other forms of piracy, the Internet Archive’s practices actually hurt sales in any way . And the long-term repercussions of this case and others in the same domain are yet to be explored and may be detrimental to libraries and digital lending in general."},

In the last month, X posted two dozen job openings evenly split across its safety and cybersecurity teams . The jobs on X’s safety team range from director of strategic response on X’s safety team to government affairs managers. On its cybersecurity teams, X is hiring several security engineers and a threat intelligence specialist. These are small numbers compared to the number of staff Musk laid off following his $44 billion acquisition of the company, formerly known as Twitter, in late 2022. In April 2023, Musk told the BBC that Twitter, as it was known then, reduced its headcount by 6,000 workers in six months, leaving the company’s workforce at around 1,500 employees when layoffs were completed. Those cuts had included significant reductions for the company’s trust and safety team. In January this year, following an inquiry from Australia’s online safety commissioner, X said that it had laid off 80% of its trust and safety staff since Musk’s takeover. X also said in its responses that before Musk’s acquisition, the company had 279 engineers on its trust and safety teams around the world, which were cut down to 55 by the end of May 2023. Overall, X said it reduced its 4,062-strong trust and safety team by almost a third to 2,849 employees; its full-time content moderation team from 107 to 51 employees; and its contracted moderators from 2,613 to 2,305 employees, according to the Australian eSafety Commissioner’s report at the time . The recent job listings appear to confirm that X is trying to further beef up its safety team following the company’s announcement in January that it would create a new Trust and Safety center in Austin, Texas, which will include 100 full-time content moderators. Nine of the two-dozen jobs posted in the last month mention Austin among the possible locations, though the postings also include other cities, like New York City and Palo Alto, California, plus international offices like Manila in the Philippines and Delhi in India. When TechCrunch asked X’s press team a series of questions about these new hires, including the size of the company’s safety and cybersecurity teams, the company responded with an automated message: “Busy now, please check back later.” Departure’s in X’s trust and safety and cybersecurity teams have not been limited to its staff, but also included senior leadership. Since Musk took over, both the company’s chief cybersecurity officer Lea Kissner and the company’s trust and safety lead Ella Irwin have left. The reduction in staff on the trust and safety and cybersecurity teams appear to have hurt X’s ability to secure itself and its users, as well as deal with complex content moderation issues all over the world. On Friday, the Supreme Court in Brazil essentially banned X across the country after Musk refused to remove accounts spreading misinformation. Since taking over as Twitter’s owner, Musk himself has been accused of spreading hateful content and misinformation. On Tuesday, Musk promoted a podcast episode featuring a guest accused of engaging in Holocaust denialism . Also this week, Musk posted on X several images from an AI generator showing someone that looks vaguely like Vice President Kamala Harris wearing a beret with the Communist hammer-and-sickle. On the cybersecurity side, Musk hosted an X Spaces event with former President Donald Trump, which crashed and was delayed . Musk blamed the crash — without providing evidence — on “a massive [distributed denial-of-service] attack on X.”"},
{"category": "AI", "title": "This Week in AI: VCs (and devs) are enthusiastic about AI coding tools", "date": "2024-09-04", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/this-week-in-ai-vcs-and-devs-are-enthusiastic-about-ai-coding-tools/", "content": "Hiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here . This week in AI, two startups developing tools to generate and suggest code — Magic and Codeium — raised nearly half a billion dollars combined. The rounds were high even by AI sector standards , especially considering that Magic hasn’t launched a product or generated revenue yet. So why the investor enthusiasm? Well, coding isn’t an easy — or inexpensive — business. And there’s demand from both companies and individual developers for ways to streamline the more arduous processes around it. According to one survey , the average dev spends close to 20% of their workweek maintaining existing code rather than writing anything new. In a separate study , companies said that excessive code maintenance (including addressing technical debt and fixing poorly performing code) costs them $85 billion per year in lost opportunities. AI tools can assist here, many devs and firms believe. And, for what it’s worth, consultants agree. In a 2023 report , analysts at McKinsey wrote that AI coding tools can enable devs to write new code in half the time and optimize existing code in roughly two-thirds the time. Now, a coding AI isn’t a silver bullet. The McKinsey report also found that certain, more complex workloads — like those requiring familiarity with a specific programming framework — didn’t necessarily benefit from AI. In fact, it took junior developers longer to finish some tasks with AI versus without, according to the report’s co-authors. “Participant feedback indicates that developers actively iterated with the tools to achieve [high] quality, signaling that the technology is best used to augment developers rather than replace them,” the co-authors wrote, driving the point home that AI is no substitute for experience. “Ultimately, to maintain code quality, developers need to understand the attributes that make up quality code and prompt the tool for the right outputs.” AI coding tools also have unresolved security- and IP-related issues. Some analyses show the tools have resulted in more mistaken code being pushed to codebases over the past few years. Code-generating tools trained on copyrighted code, meanwhile, have been caught regurgitating that code when prompted in a certain way, posing a liability risk to the developers using them. But that’s not dampening enthusiasm for coding AI from devs — or their employers, for that matter. The majority of developers (upward of 97%) in a 2024 GitHub poll said that they’ve adopted AI tools in some form. According to that same poll, 59% to 88% of companies are encouraging — or now allowing — the use of assistive programming tools. So it’s not terribly surprising that the AI coding tools market could be worth some $27 billion by 2032 ( per Polaris Research) — particularly if, as Gartner predicts , 75% of enterprise software devs use AI coding assistants by 2028. The market’s already hot. Generative AI coding startups Cognition , Poolside and Anysphere have closed mammoth rounds in the past year — and GitHub’s AI coding tool Copilot has over 1.8 million paying users . The productivity gains the tools could deliver have been sufficient to convince investors — and customers — to ignore their flaws. But we’ll see if the trend holds — and exactly for how long. “Emotion AI” attracts investments: Julie writes how some VCs and businesses are being drawn to “emotion AI,” the more sophisticated sibling of sentiment analysis, and how this could be problematic. Why home robots still suck: Brian explores why many of the attempts at home robots have failed spectacularly. It comes down to pricing, functionality and efficacy, he says. Amazon hires Covariant founders: On the subject of robots, Amazon last week hired robotics startup Covariant’s founders along with “about a quarter” of the company’s employees. It also signed a nonexclusive license to use Covariant’s AI robotics models. NightCafe, the OG image generator: Yours truly profiled NightCafe, one of the original image generators and a marketplace for AI-generated content. It’s still alive and kicking, despite moderation challenges. Midjourney gets into hardware: NightCafe rival Midjourney is getting into hardware. The company made the announcement in a post on X; its new hardware team will be based in San Francisco, it said. SB 1047 passes: California’s legislature just passed AI bill SB 1047. Max writes about why some hope the governor won’t sign it. Google rolls out election safeguards: Google is gearing up for the U.S. presidential election by rolling out safeguards for more of its generative AI apps and services. As part of the restrictions, most of the company’s AI products won’t respond to election-related topics. Apple and Nvidia could invest in OpenAI: Nvidia and Apple are reportedly in talks to contribute to OpenAI’s next fundraising round — a round that could value the ChatGPT maker at $100 billion. Who needs a game engine when you have AI? Researchers at Tel Aviv University and DeepMind, Google’s AI R&D division, last week previewed GameNGen, an AI system that can simulate the game Doom at up to 20 frames per second. Trained on extensive footage of Doom gameplay, the model can effectively predict the next “gaming state” when a player “controls” the character in the simulation. It’s a game generated in real time. GameNGen isn’t the first model to do so. OpenAI’s Sora can simulate games, including Minecraft , and a group of university researchers unveiled an Atari-game-simulating AI early this year. (Other models along these lines run the gamut from World Models to GameGAN and Google’s own Genie .) But GameNGen is one of the more impressive game-simulating attempts yet in terms of its performance. The model isn’t without big limitations, namely graphical glitches and an inability to “remember” more than three seconds of gameplay (meaning GameNGen can’t create a functional game, really). But it could be a step toward entirely new sorts of games — like procedurally generated games on steroids. As my colleague Devin Coldewey has written about before , AI is taking over the field of weather forecasting, from a quick, “How long will this rain last?” to a 10-day outlook, all the way out to century-level predictions. One of the newest models to hit the scene, Aurora is the product of Microsoft’s AI research org. Trained on various weather and climate datasets, Aurora can be fine-tuned to specific forecasting tasks with relatively little data, Microsoft claims. “Aurora is a machine learning model that can predict atmospheric variables, such as temperature,” Microsoft explains on the model’s GitHub page. “We provide three specialized versions: one for medium-resolution weather prediction, one for high-resolution weather prediction and one for air pollution prediction.” Aurora’s performance appears to be quite good relative to other atmosphere-tracking models. (In less than a minute, it can produce a five-day global air pollution forecast or a ten-day high-resolution weather forecast.) But it’s not immune to the hallucinatory tendencies of other AI models. Aurora can make mistakes, which is why Microsoft cautions that it shouldn’t be “used by people or businesses to plan their operations.” Last week, Inc. reported that Scale AI, the AI data-labeling startup, laid off scores of annotators — the folks responsible for labeling the training datasets used to develop AI models. As of publication time, there hasn’t been an official announcement. But one former employee told Inc. that as many as hundreds were let go. (Scale AI disputes this.) Most of the annotators who work for Scale AI aren’t employed by the company directly. Rather, they’re hired by one of Scale’s subsidiaries or a third-party firm, giving them less job security. Labelers sometimes go long stretches without receiving work. Or they’re unceremoniously booted off Scale’s platform, as happened to contractors in Thailand, Vietnam, Poland and Pakistan recently . Of the layoffs last week, a Scale spokesperson told TechCrunch that it hires contractors through a company called HireArt. “These individuals [i.e., those who lost their jobs] were employees of HireArt and received severance and COBRA benefits through the end of the month from HireArt. Last week, less than 65 people were laid off. We built up this contracted workforce and scaled it to appropriate sizing as our operating model evolved over the past nine months, less than 500 have been laid off in the United States.” It’s a little hard to parse exactly what Scale AI means with this carefully worded statement, but we are looking into it. If you are a former employee of Scale AI or a contractor who was recently laid off, contact us however you feel comfortable doing so."},

It’ll be led by Oxford philosopher Philipp Koralus — another of the Institute’s founding fellows — and will aim to “translate the philosophical principles of human flourishing into open source software and AI systems.” What does “translating the philosophical principles of human flourishing” entail, exactly? Unclear. But the crux is to foster the creation of AI tech that respects human dignity while avoiding promoting harmful disruption (e.g., automation leading to job loss). A high and nebulous bar, to be sure — but one the HAI Lab is going to strive for. The Institute is also spinning up a fellowship — the Cosmos Fellowship — with a cohort of four fellows to start. Working at the HAI Lab or other partner institutions for between “a term and a year,” fellows will collaborate with Cosmos mentors and pursue independent projects to “[explore the] intersection of AI expertise and deep philosophical insight,” McCord said. There’s an investment component to the Institute’s plans, and it’s launching in the form of a venture org: Cosmos Ventures. Led by former DeepMind product lead Jason Zhao, ex-Stripe head of corporate strategy Alex Komoroske, Darren Zhu, and Zoe Weinberg, Cosmos Ventures will support “provocative new prototypes, essays and creative projects that explore fundamental questions around the philosophy of technology,” McCord said. McCord characterizes Cosmos Ventures as “low overhead,” modeled after Institute fellow Tyler Cowen’s Emergent Ventures . Investments will range between $1,000 and $10,000 per project, and projects — which can be new or existing — must produce a “major deliverable” within three months. The first group has already been funded, McCord said. The Cosmos Institute isn’t the first to attempt to advance a more ethical, humanistic vision of AI. OpenAI, founded with the mission of delivering the benefits of advanced AI to all humanity, has dismantled entire safety teams. Clark’s own Anthropic once positioned itself as a safer, more ethical vendor, but in recent months has pushed back on AI regulations and aggressively scraped data without permission. Perhaps the Cosmos Institute will fare better with its embrace of what McCord calls “accelerationism”: the idea that the future isn’t predetermined and therefore humanity is responsible for what it holds. “We must build AI that encourages inquiry over complacency and promotes active engagement over passive dependence, especially in education, medicine, the public square and other vital domains,” McCord writes. “We champion AI that decentralizes power and enables bottom-up solutions, allowing individuals and communities to co-create a richer, more diverse society.” They’re admirable positions. This reporter only hopes that money, influence and power don’t make the temptation to abandon them irresistible."},

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first or second quarter of Paylocity’s fiscal year, which would be sometime in the next 30 to 60 days. It is being funded by borrowings under Paylocity’s revolving credit facility. It’s a decent exit for seven-year-old Airbase, which was founded by Thejo Kote in 2017 to provide software to midsized companies seeking to better manage their spending. Its platform included bill payments, corporate cards, and employee reimbursements, among other things. The San Francisco-based fintech company had raised just over $100 million in equity funding since inception from investors such as Menlo Ventures, Bain Capital and First Round Capital, among others. According to PitchBook, Airbase was valued at $600 million post-money in 2021 at the peak of the market. Headquartered in Schaumburg, Illinois, Paylocity is publicly traded and, according to Yahoo Finance , has a current market capitalization of just under $9 billion, with about 40,000 customers. The company in a statement said the addition of Airbase would help it expand its total addressable market beyond human capital management (HCM) and “further into the office of the CFO.” Kote told TechCrunch the decision wasn’t easy but made sense in the end. “Airbase has many years of runway and a clear path to profitability, but I was ultimately convinced by the fantastic opportunity to create a unified HCM and Finance platform for the mid-market — leveraging Paylocity’s size and scale to bring Airbase to a much larger audience.” A source familiar with the deal who wished to remain anonymous told TechCrunch that the structured deal does not include all of the cash on Airbase’s balance sheet, which goes back to the company, shareholders and employees. Including that, the entire value of the deal is actually “a little less than $400 million,” the source said. Airbase has just over 300 employees. It is not yet known how many will be joining Paylocity. The company over the years has competed with the likes of Ramp and Brex, with a focus on selling software from its early days. At one point, it said it surpassed “eight figures” in annual recurring revenue (ARR), although the company has not shared exact numbers. This isn’t the first exit for Kote, who in 2017 sold Automatic to SiriusXM for over $100 million . Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here .

This means Oyster has maintained its market value at a time when many other tech companies have been forced into down rounds, bucking a painful trend. Winding the clock back to 2021 — when the world was in the throws of the pandemic and remote working surged as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns — Oyster’s $50 million Series B was raised on a $475 million valuation. Since then, remote and hybrid working have become established and that’s reflected in some far higher valuations. Oyster competes with a number of other HR platforms, including Deel , which at last count was valued at a staggering $12 billion (versus $5.5 billion back in October 2021, when it raised a $425 million Series D. Then it topped up with $50 million in May 2022 on a $12 billion valuation). Other competitors include Papaya Global (now also valued at over $1 billion), Turing and Remote , among others. Over a call with TechCrunch, Oyster’s CEO and co-founder, Tony Jamous, admitted the company raised its Series C “at the peak of the market.” However, he emphasized the sunny side: It’s been able to maintain the valuation, “despite the fact that the market’s had a reset on valuations, generally.” He’s also quick to point out that the latest valuation is still more than at the last funding round, adding: “We’ve grown significantly … more than 7x in two years, and we improved our margins tremendously. It’s a completely different business financially. So I’m glad that we did not have a down round, which would have been the expected scenario if we didn’t grow that much and improved the business in that time.” Oyster’s USP is a focus on helping make it easy for companies to pay remote workers in emerging markets. It can do this by employing the worker on the other company’s behalf — and then remitting the salary that the client pays Oyster. It says over 40% of the people employed on its platform are in emerging markets, adding that it remitted “hundreds of millions” to workers in emerging markets in 2023. The new funding will be used to accelerate development of the platform, and expand more generally. In the last year, Oyster — which is B Corp-certified — has launched several new products and services, including Global Payroll, Visa Sponsorships and local compensation insights, which help companies deal with staff hired across over 180 countries. It’s also launched a no-code offering that enables customers to offer global hiring, payroll, and rewards right within their own HR product. Clients include the likes of BambooHR, Quora, Lokalise, Printify and TriNet. While hybrid and remote working are clearly here to stay, Jamous talks up a trend he couches as “a shift to global employment.” He says this means the ability to “reverse brain drain” from developing countries and help them retain homegrown talent. “That’s why we’re the only B Corp in our category … and everything we do is focused on democratizing global job opportunities,” he said. Jamous, whose family had to leave Lebanon after the civil war, has had an incredible run after he sold his first company to Ericsson for $6.5 billion. He’s long said he wanted to build something to deliver a positive impact on the world, and — with Oyster — he reckons he’s hit the spot. The big question, however, is how does he feel about competing against category behemoths like Deel that can, perhaps unfairly, make a $1.2 billion valuation look slightly pedestrian. Jamous argues Oyster’s focus on cross-border employment helps set it apart. “The others are becoming multi-purpose platforms, moving into HR, and payroll,” he suggests, saying this means they’re competing against clients’ own in-house HR and payroll systems — which he argues can end up being confusing and counterproductive. “We want to provide companies with their own means to do global employment, and we’re not going to go into their other spaces like HR,” he added. In a supporting statement on the Series D raise, Shawn O’Neill, managing partner of Oyster’s lead investor Silver Lake Waterman , said: “Global employment is incredibly complex, involving many moving parts. … In just four years, Oyster built a platform of trusted tools and resources for bulletproof global compliance and in-depth local HR knowledge — a strategy that has made them one of the leaders in the market.” Existing investors also participated in Oyster’s Series D, including Emergence Capital, Endeavor Catalyst, G2 Venture Partners, Georgian and Stripes."},

Once linked, parents will be alerted to their teen’s channel activity, including the number of uploads, subscriptions, and comments — not the content. They’ll also receive email notifications about events, like a new upload or livestream. The company tells TechCrunch that the act of linking the account won’t influence the YouTube algorithm in terms of what’s shown to the teen, however, as that’s already personalized to the user. Parents also aren’t able to inform YouTube of the child’s real age via the act of account linking, as YouTube defers to the age the teen entered when they signed up for YouTube. However, parents will be able to be alerted to new uploads across YouTube and YouTube Shorts, even if they’re private or unlisted videos, and they’ll be able to see when video privacy settings are changed. The new experience builds on the parental controls YouTube introduced back in 2021 , which allowed parents to test supervised accounts with children under the age of consent for online services; that’s age 13 in the U.S. but different in other countries. The company at that time had said it would expand to older age groups in the future. Supervised experiences on social media platforms have arisen as the tech giants have tried to either get ahead of or align themselves with incoming regulations and laws around their services’ use by minors. In the U.S., Utah, Arkansas and others have even passed laws restricting children under 18 from joining social media sites without parents’ consent, though these are being held up by the courts or by further legislative changes . Other social apps, including TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram and Facebook have also previously rolled out parental controls that involve supervised accounts linked to parents. Though YouTube isn’t always thought of as being in the same category as social apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or TikTok, it does offer a social experience that includes things like user profiles, the ability to follow creators, support for commenting, and access to entertainment that’s driven by an algorithm, among other things. YouTube says the new experience for teens will begin rolling out to parents this week, allowing parents to link their accounts to their teens via the new Family Center hub in the app. Google’s parental controls service Family Link will also offer parents access to an entry point to these new controls from its app. The experience should reach YouTube’s global users over the next several weeks. In addition, parents will have access to resources created with Common Sense Networks, an affiliate of Common Sense Media, to help them guide teens on responsible content creation. The company says it also worked with its Youth and Families Advisory Committee on the development of the new controls. To date, YouTube’s products for kids, including the YouTube Kids app and supervised experiences for pre-teens, reach more than 100 million active users per month, the company notes, including both logged-in and logged-out viewers."},

The woman, Dimple Patel, turned herself in on Tuesday. Patel was also charged with homicide by vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, tampering with evidence, careless driving, reckless driving and prohibited text-based communications, according to a report sent by Pennsylvania State Police. Patel was driving on Interstate 95 at around 3:20 a.m. ET when the crash occurred. She was traveling at about 71 miles per hour in her 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E with the BlueCruise hands-free driving feature and Adaptive Cruise Control systems activated at the time of the crash. The men, identified as Aktilek Baktybekov and Tolobek Esenbekov, had pulled over to the left side of the highway and exited their vehicles. Patel rear-ended one of the cars and killed both of the men. In a statement, the Pennsylvania State Police urged drivers to always stay alert and limit distractions when driving. “No partially automated vehicle technology should ever be left alone to perform the driving tasks that are required to safely navigate the roads of the Commonwealth,” according to the statement sent to TechCrunch. “While the advancements in technology are immense, always strive to maintain proper control of your vehicle. If you are driving hands free, be aware and ready to regain control if the situation warrants your immediate reaction.” The fatal crash in Pennsylvania — along with another one that happened in Texas in February — is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation. It’s one of a number of ongoing efforts to scrutinize the use of partial automation. But it’s one of the first cases where charges have been brought against the driver, who is supposed to supervise the driver assistance system’s performance and take over if it is about to crash."},

That includes €1 million in debt facilities. While the amount isn’t as impressive as some of Cowboy’s previous fundraises, the company has been looking for an investor outside of the traditional European VC firms that have already invested in the startup — an investor that could potentially open new doors. As a result, Cypress Capital is leading the round. The Hong Kong-based investment firm has strong ties with Taiwan, which is a key hub for the global bicycle industry. “A lot of our Asian-based suppliers are Taiwanese for historical reasons. We are growing the portion of our European suppliers continuously as we have about half of our parts that come from European suppliers. But the other half comes from Asia and mostly from Taiwanese suppliers,” Cowboy co-founder and CEO Adrien Roose (pictured above right) told TechCrunch. Existing investors Index Ventures, Hardware Club, Future Positive Capital, Isomer and Exor are also participating once again in Wednesday’s funding round. Cowboy will also launch an equity crowdfunding campaign to give an opportunity to its customers to invest in the company. “We’ve been raising somewhere between €10 [million] and €20 million a year over the last few years,” Roose said. “And yeah, the amount has gone down. Last year we raised €8 million in equity and €5 million of debt. And now we’re just announcing a €5 million raise, which is a fairly small raise for a company of our size.” According to him, the company needs to raise less capital because it requires less capital. Cowboy should be more or less breakeven on an EBITDA basis for the second half of this year. Next year, he says, the company will turn a profit for the first time since its inception. “And we don’t want to raise more than what we need, especially in these market conditions,” Roose added. It doesn’t mean that Cowboy won’t raise ever again. However, it’s been a wild ride for the startup as the e-bike industry experienced a significant boost in sales after COVID-related lockdowns. The company’s valuation peaked around that time. But then, demand slowed down quite drastically. VanMoof, another European e-bike startup backed by venture capitalists, declared bankruptcy . It had a chilling effect on the entire industry. With this recent funding round, Cowboy is now valued at €40 million on a pre-money basis. But now, all eyes are on profitability — not the company’s valuation. “We’re starting to see a ray of sunshine after the rain,” Roose said. And believe it or not, rain plays an important part in Cowboy’s sales. The company usually sells more bikes during the spring as people start thinking about cycling to work and other places. It’s been particularly rainy in Europe this year, so Cowboy’s sales have been a bit underwhelming. The company originally focused on a single model and iterated on the design over the years. After Cowboy 1 came Cowboy 2 , Cowboy 3 and Cowboy 4 . The company is now moving away from numbers and expanding its lineup to other form factors. Cowboy added the Cruiser, a model with an upright riding posture and a step-through version to appeal to more riders. This year, the company added the Cowboy Cross model, an all-road model that aims for comfort and long-distance trips. Similarly, Cowboy has diversified its distribution channels. In addition to its online stores, Cowboy now sells its e-bikes in traditional bicycle stores. “Since last year, we started doing partnerships with local bike shops because the fact is that 80% of e-bikes sold in Europe are still sold through these bike shops, and so we want to embrace that,” Roose said. Behind the scenes, Cowboy bikes share the same electronic platform and software features, such as theft alerts, crash detection, in-app challenges and AdaptivePower. This feature, which has been recently updated, automatically adjusts the power of the motor depending on the current slope or wind conditions. “We’ve invested lots of time, efforts and capital into building that platform that works really well. And now we want to capitalize on it and essentially build a family of products,” Roose said. “So we have the Classic, the Cruiser, the Cross. And you will see more bikes from us in the future.”"},

The high-stakes mission is now set to officially conclude on Friday, with Starliner making its undocking attempt around 6:04 p.m. EST. Should all go to plan, the spacecraft will land at New Mexico’s White Sands Space Harbor approximately six hours later. These final maneuvers will bring to a close a troubled first crewed mission for the Boeing-made Starliner. It was meant to be the final certification mission before the vehicle could enter operation as a regular transporter for astronauts traveling to and from the International Space Station. But technical problems, including issues with several of the spacecraft’s thrusters and a handful of helium leaks in the propulsion systems, cropped up shortly before the vehicle attempted to dock with the station on June 6. The two astronauts onboard, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, ended up boarding the ISS safely. But the issues ultimately extended the mission by several months as NASA and Boeing engineers worked to try to determine the root cause of the anomalies. After weeks of testing, both on the ground using replica hardware and on orbit, NASA ultimately decided on August 24 that Starliner should return to Earth empty, and Wilmore and Williams will come home using a SpaceX capsule in February 2025 instead. The return trip will have one major difference from normal return missions from the ISS, which is that Starliner will conduct what’s called a “breakout burn” to quickly move it up and away from the station. This maneuver — which is actually 12 small burns, with an orbital velocity of just 0.1 meter per second each — will see the thrusters pulsing for a shorter period of time than they did during the approach to the station. For this reason, the breakout burn will likely not cause the same problems as engineers observed at the start of the mission, and thus pose no safety threat to the ISS, said Steve Stich, NASA’s commercial crew program manager, during a news conference. “The reasons we chose doing this breakout burn is it gets the vehicle away from station faster,” he said. “Without the crew on board, able to take manual control if needed, there’s just a lot less variables we need to account for when we do the breakout burn, and it allows us to get the vehicle on the trajectory home that much sooner.” The next critical maneuver will be the 60-second deorbit burn, which will put Starliner into Earth’s atmosphere and en route to White Sands. The spacecraft will deploy parachutes and airbags to make a soft landing on the ground. “We anticipate a good burn, and we have a lot of redundancy, and that’s what we’re relying on to have a safe entry,” he added. NASA and Boeing will go through a few months of post-flight analysis of the spacecraft’s performance, but Stich said the teams are already looking at modifications to the system or additional testing to get the vehicle fully certified by the space agency. But it’s unclear what the ultimate path will be to certify the spacecraft — let alone how much more it might cost Boeing, which has already incurred costs totaling more than $1.5 billion related to the Starliner program. It’s also unclear whether Boeing would need to perform another crewed test mission. If NASA and Boeing’s joint flight control team decides not to perform the undock on Friday, there will be several other opportunities in the coming days. Astronauts onboard the space station have modified the SpaceX Dragon vehicle that’s currently attached to the station with temporary seats in case of an emergency."},

That information became easier to convey with a Mac app called Boom , now available as a freemium product. Boom is a bootstrapped company built by former Shopify employees Robleh Jama and Krishna Satya. The app works with all major video conferencing apps, including Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Once installed, you can add customized themes to your video call appearances, including your name, designation, location, time, and weather. Plus, it lets you react through on-screen effects, stickers, and GIFs during calls. You can tweak your appearance, too, with controls for things like brightness, contrast, saturation, shadow, hue, and exposure. There are different presets for various appearances, as well. What’s more, users can design an off-camera screen to show a customized design rather than a blank screen. The company is also now rolling out a new feature to track meeting times The co-founders told TechCrunch that they started working on the idea during remote work days at Shopify. “We realized we weren’t just knowledge workers anymore—we were all streamers now. We had the hardware: nice cameras, mics, our home offices doubling as broadcast studios. But the software? Still just vanilla Zoom, Meet, and Teams. That frustration with the existing tools is what sparked Boom,” they said. Boom co-founders emphasized that the product is to make video calls more fun and engaging across different apps. The startup has been testing the product for over a year, with the public release in April. The company previously offered a paid-only product, but this summer it has tweaked its pricing model to become a freemium service. Users can use the virtual camera, themes, and reactions for free. However, advanced camera controls premium themes, custom branding, and screen share features like presenter overlay and cursor highlights magnifier will cost you $8 per month, $80 per year, or $219 for a lifetime license. Later this month, the startup will launch a timeboxing feature to limit specific discussion topics. For the next release cycle, Boom is working on features like an agenda tracker, dynamic polls, and quizzes. Boom co-founders think they can grow the product organically without venture backing. “We’re pretty set on taking a more independent path and not going the VC route. Our goal is to make Boom so useful that it grows organically and profitably for 10+ years. If we can do that while staying indie, that’s the dream,” they said. The story has been updated with new pricing tiers Boom rolled out this week ."},

According to a recent poll , 76% of financial services firms increased their compliance expenditure from 2022 to 2023, with most blaming new laws . With the cost of compliance averaging out to around $10,000 per employee these days, many firms are searching for ways to reduce spending without running afoul of regulators. Entrepreneurs Nir Laznik and Eyal Peleg say that they’ve created a solution — powered by generative AI, as is the trend. Laznik and Peleg co-founded Sedric , an AI-powered platform designed to help financial institutions implement compliance rules and flag possible issues. Prior to Sedric, Laznik spearheaded several startups, including a photo kiosk software firm, while Peleg spent close to eight years at Intel’s AI and machine learning org. “We realized there was disproportionate pressure on mid-size organizations, combined with a new set of challenges for banks,” Laznik said. “We knew the rapid advancements in AI could address these problems in an entirely new way. This convergence of factors led us to create Sedric.” Sedric’s AI acts as an overseer of sorts, monitoring a workforce’s outbound and inbound calls, chats, emails, social media DMs, and instant messages. It attempts to flag compliance problems (e.g. omitted disclosures, missed steps, and misconduct) as they happen; Sedric can automatically “mitigate” issues and provide coaching to the offending staff in many cases, Laznik claims. “This technology empowers compliance officers with a holistic view of their customer touchpoints across multiple channels, allowing them to flag deviations from established compliance policies and guidelines quickly and efficiently,” Laznik said. “Our platform covers the entire compliance lifecycle, from policy setting to enforcement, correction and audit.” Surveillance that deep might sound a little intrusive — not least of which because Sedric “scores” interactions on a per-employee basis according to adherence to company policies. But, for better or worse, U.S. state and federal guidelines give wide discretion to businesses engaged in monitoring their staff so long as the businesses are reasonably transparent about it. Moreover, some federal-level regulations — particularly regulations pertaining to insider trading, collusion, and the sharing of certain earnings documents — mandate that financial institutions closely track workers in their interactions with customers and the broader marketplace. These preempt state laws, like New York’s and Connecticut’s, that impose additional requirements on employers conducting workforce monitoring. I asked Laznik about the potential for bias in Sedric’s AI, given that the AI is likely to be monitoring communications of staff from all different backgrounds. Biased AI can lead to discrimination, depending on where and how it’s deployed — whether intentional or no. Studies have shown that some AI trained to detect toxicity sees phrases in African-American Vernacular English, the informal grammar used by some Black Americans, as disproportionately “toxic.” Other studies have demonstrated how speech recognition systems are more likely to wrongly transcribe audio of Black speakers as opposed to their white counterparts. Laznik says that Sedric uses “fine-tuned models” trained on “proprietary datasets curated and validated in collaboration with industry experts” to try to minimize bias. The company also monitors for performance dips in deployed models and retrains models when necessary. “Our platform enables customers to provide direct feedback through various annotation inputs, which are then vetted by compliance teams and are used for re-training or integrated into the prediction process,” he added. “This ensures that our models become increasingly tailored for each customer.” To protect customer — and employee — privacy and security, Sedric allows companies to configure where their data is stored and implement controls that redact (or at least attempt to redact) personally identifiable information. “At Sedric, we’ve designed our platform with compliance and security at its core,” Lazink said. “Enterprises can set their own retention policies and compliance guidelines according to their internal guidelines and specific regulations.” Sedric, which also offers tools to support call center agents as they’re chatting with clients on the phone, has “hundreds” of paying compliance officers and enterprise customers in the U.S. and Europe, Laznik claims. Revenue has increased fivefold over the last year — although Laznik declined to give firmer numbers. “For small- and medium-sized businesses, we offer an off-the-shelf solution, and for enterprises and banks, we offer a hybrid model with tailored customizations,” Lazink said. “Our focus on the specific needs of financial institutions, combined with our proprietary library of pre-trained, regulation-inspired models that can also be customized to each organization’s unique requirements, sets us apart in the market.” Going after finance customers and use cases specifically certainly appears to have worked in Sedric’s favor, setting the company apart from workplace monitoring rivals such as Fairwords, Shield, Erudit and Aware . It’s a crowded — and often controversial — market, but investors still sense some opportunity, particularly as AI becomes more deeply embedded in these types of tools. Case in point: Seemingly pleased with Sedric’s progress so far, Foundation Capital led an $18.5 million Series A investment in the four-year-old company that also had participation from Amex Ventures. The new cash will be put toward growing the firm’s go-to-market and R&D teams “significantly” in NYC and Tel Aviv, Lazink said, and brings New York-based Sedric’s total raised to $22 million. Sedric plans to double its headcount in the next 12 months."},

Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at its September 9 “It’s Glowtime” event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn’t invite us to fly across the country for a single product — not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it’s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays. The livestream kicks off on Monday at 10 a.m. PT . The invites dropped last week with the “Glowtime” tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most. Back at WWDC in June , Apple finally revealed its approach to generative AI. The offering is an extremely Apple approach, right down to the name — Apple Intelligence — which happily hijacks the familiar AI initialism. The “small model” method is emblematic of the company in the sense that it’s trained on limited data relevant to improving the user experience. That’s a marked difference between it and much larger “black box” models like OpenAI’s and Google’s Gemini . The efficacy of the approach remains to be seen, as we wait for Apple Intelligence’s wider release. It will almost certainly be a work in progress, as — at the very least — all of generative AI is, at the end of the day. The answer for how this all ties into “Glowtime” can be found in Siri. In June, Apple announced a much-needed glow up for the O.G. smart assistant . Along with generative AI models and better app integration, the company revealed an updated interface. Gone is the familiar colorful Siri circle, swapped out for a glowing border that surrounds the display when Siri is listening/processing. Out of every iPhone ever launched, two models will be able to run Apple Intelligence : the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. According to the company, that’s due to limitations with older chips. Given that non-Pro iPhone 15 models are effectively running the iPhone 14 Pro’s chipset, Apple can credibly make the argument that only one of its chips so far was built with Apple Intelligence in mind. You can decide for yourself whether you think the exclusion of the iPhone 15 is entirely a hardware matter. With all of this in mind, next week’s event is the perfect chance to announce that Apple Intelligence will be available across the new iPhone line. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to feature the thinnest bezels on a smartphone 🔥 pic.twitter.com/rK9LEugcb1 We’re heading toward the promise of true edge-to-edge displays millimeter by millimeter. According to one recent leak, the iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an even larger display, courtesy of smaller bezels, moving from 1.5mm to 1.4mm. So, what’s a few fractions of a millimeter between friends? A lot when you’re talking about a total size of under 2mm, turns out. That will reportedly bump the Pro Max’s screen size from 6.69 to 6.86 inches, without increasing the device’s overall footprint by some unwieldy amount. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is already a big phone. The iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, is said to be making the leap from 6.12 to 6.27 inches. Camera improvements are a no-brainer for annual updates. The most interesting of the bunch is a new glass molded lens that is thinner and lighter, while dramatically increasing optical zoom capabilities. Optical zoom capabilities are worth paying attention to, as they don’t suffer from the same sort of image degradation issues as their digital counterpart. pic.twitter.com/GiIWNkXcI8 Leaked dummy models from early in the year give us a rough idea of each model’s design. Most notable on the 16 and 16 Plus are the shift from a diagonal to vertical camera setup. The models, which are designed for third parties to get a jumpstart on accessories, feature the addition of a new “Capture” button across the line. The new feature is designed to provide quick access to different camera capabilities. The most welcome change, however, may be bigger batteries . Screen and camera improvements are all well and good, but battery life remains a struggle. This particular report could use more substantiating, so take that with an even larger grain of salt than usual. Additional reports , meanwhile, have pointed to Apple making battery replacements more accessible for users. Given that the company has begun offering home repair options as more governments and localities pass right to repair laws, this one certainly tracks. The Pro models are also expected to gain Wi-Fi 7, which would be a big boon for the latest wireless standard. As hard as it is to believe, the Apple Watch turns 10 this year. They grow up so quickly. Apple made a big splash with the iPhone X, so it follows that it’d have something similar planned for the Apple Watch Series 10 (Series X?). Earlier rumors pointing to a significant redesign have cooled in recent months, making way for a familiar design with a larger display, bumping up to 45mm and 49mm models. The new watch should also be slimmer than its predecessor — something especially important when discussing a watch. Like the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 should get a new processor — the S10, one imagines. That could mean that additional AI functionality isn’t far out. A glucose monitor is the most exciting rumored addition. Sleep apnea detection is also rumored for the device, but as Bloomberg notes , Apple’s legal woes with Masimo may well trip up that feature. A long-awaited update to the budget Apple Watch SE with a plastic body could also appear next week. Stay with me on this one . Apple is reportedly announcing two versions of the AirPods 4 next week. The cheaper model will replace the still-available AirPods 2, and the more premium version will replace the AirPods 3. Still with me? The more premium model is set to blur the line between it and the AirPods Pro, by adding Active Noise Cancelation and Find My features. All of the models should also finally ditch Lightning for USB-C, as the company transitions its products to comply with EU mandates . So, how will Apple maintain a clear line between the mid-tier and Pro pods? We’ll have to wait on the answer to that one, as we’re not expecting new AirPods Pro next week. We may, however, finally get the over-ear AirPods Max 2, four years after the original. This one is a big maybe. Recent reporting suggests that Apple will hold off on announcing M4 macs until November. Supply chain issues have been dictating the Mac’s release calendar ever since the pandemic. A big, USB-A-less version of the Mac Mini is said to be arriving before end of year, along with a new iMac and MacBook Pro. Here’s what we can say for sure: Apple’s Glowtime event is scheduled for Monday, September 9 at 10 a.m. PT. As always, we’ll be there, bringing it to you live."},

The REPowerEU plan calls for 10 million additional heat pumps to be added by 2027, and solar panels are also on the rise. But most installations are done by small businesses that could be more productive with better work processes. This is where German startup Reonic comes in. “We give renewable installers the tools to be extremely efficient, and we do that mainly by providing them with planning and workflow software,” said co-founder Tristan Menzinger (sitting on the right in the picture above). Menzinger, Lars-Manuel Schneider (sitting in the middle in the picture above), and their university mate and third co-founder Udo Sill all worked at a research institute exploring renewable energy deployment. It sparked their interest in starting Reonic, but they had to listen to real customers to bridge the gap between theory and knowledge. They concluded that installers needed end-to-end software, rather than separate tools. Startups in other sectors have reached a similar conclusion, but it can be a tough sell when the target audience already has ingrained habits. Reonic’s promise is to make it worth it by helping installers sell faster, and sell more. “Being able to combine heat pumps, for example, with solar systems, doubles the volume that you’re selling,” Schneider said. Unlike some competitors with narrower niches, such as solar, Reonic’s focus is renewable energy as a whole, whether that’s photovoltaics, energy storage systems, wallboxes, or heat pumps. Beyond a specific type of installation, the bigger goal they see is energy self-consumption for every household or business, Schneider said. “And this is something in the core of our product that always works the same, regardless where we are.” The promise to accelerate renewable energy adoption seems to resonate with investors; in order to expand across Europe, Reonic just raised a €13 million Series A funding round led by Northzone, with participation from existing investors Point Nine and Puzzle Ventures. This matches the preference that VCs are showing for climate-focused startups that face market risk with their go-to-market strategy, as opposed to science risk from inventing a new technology. Even then, market risk is still real. Aurora Solar, a U.S. company that provides software to help solar installers manage their sales, laid off 20% of its staff of about 500 people earlier this year after $523 million. But with 21 team members so far and €16 million in funding to date, Reonic is more akin to smaller companies like Arch , Enerflo , Lun and Scoop Solar . It’s also seeing growth typical of early-stage companies that have found some product-market fit, tripling its recurring revenue in the past six months alone, the company says. “Though we’ve had some real momentum since we started the business three years ago, in truth, we feel like we’re just getting started,” said Schneider. While subsidies and other legal frameworks vary from country to country, Reonic’s internationalization is driven by its founders’ conviction that it can enter new markets without a lot of customization. After the DACH region, it went live in France and also did a soft launch in Italy, said Menzinger, who oversaw most of the process. Augsburg, Bavaria is still their headquarters, but almost half their staff works in Berlin where they opened a second office earlier this year to recruit international talent more easily — another important piece for the expansion that its new round will help fund."},

The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze. Contrary to such speculation, however, Apple had a team in place, working on what proved to be a very Apple approach to artificial intelligence. There was still pizzazz amid the demos — Apple always loves to put on a show — but Apple Intelligence is ultimately a very pragmatic take on the category. Apple Intelligence (yes, AI for short) isn’t a standalone feature. Rather, it’s about integrating into existing offerings. While it is a branding exercise in a very real sense, the large language model (LLM) driven technology will operate behind the scenes. As far as the consumer is concerned, the technology will mostly present itself in the form of new features for existing apps. We’ll learn more during the company’s iPhone 16 event, which starts at 10 a.m. Monday . In addition to new iPhones, we also expect to see updates to the Apple Watch , AirPods and maybe even some new Macs. Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “AI for the rest of us.” The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms including ChatGPT and Google Gemini , Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music. The text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts. Image generation has been integrated as well, in similar fashion — albeit a bit less seamlessly. Users can prompt Apple Intelligence to generate custom emojis (Genmojis) in an Apple house style. Image Playground, meanwhile, is a standalone image generation app that utilizes prompts to create visual content than can be used in Messages, Keynote or shared via social media. Apple Intelligence also marks a long-awaited face-lift for Siri. The smart assistant was early to the game, but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple’s operating systems; for instance, instead of the familiar icon, users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it’s doing its thing. More important, new Siri works across apps . That means, for example, that you can ask Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It’s a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you’re currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer. It’s too early to speak to the efficacy of any of the above features. While the latest batch of Apple operating systems hit public beta this week, Apple Intelligence isn’t yet fully baked. It’s clear, however, that Apple was pressed to talk it up in June both to bely concern that it didn’t have a generative AI plan and to offer a head start for developers. While we saw demos at WWDC, we’re going to have to wait until the fall to get our hands on a beta of Apple Intelligence. As it happens, fall is also when the public versions of iOS/iPadOS 18 and Mac Sequoia will hit the App Store. The offering will be free to use, so long as you have one of the following pieces of hardware : Notably, only the Pro versions of the iPhone 15 are getting access, owing to shortcomings on the standard model’s chipset. Presumably, however, the whole iPhone 16 line will be able to run Apple Intelligence when it arrives. Apple has taken a small-model , bespoke approach to training. Rather than relying on the kind of kitchen sink approach that fuels platforms like GPT and Gemini, the company has compiled datasets in-house for specific tasks like, say, composing an email. The biggest benefit of this approach is that many of these tasks become far less resource intensive and can be performed on-device. That doesn’t apply to everything, however. More complex queries will utilize the new Private Cloud Compute offering. The company now operates remote servers running on Apple Silicon, which it claims allows it to offer the same level of privacy as its consumer devices. Whether an action is being performed locally or via the cloud will be invisible to the user, unless their device is offline, at which point remote queries will toss up an error. A lot was made about Apple’s pending partnership with OpenAI ahead of WWDC. Ultimately, however, it turned out that the deal was less about powering Apple Intelligence and more about offering an alternative platform for those things it’s not really built for. It’s a tacit acknowledgement that building a small-model system has its limitation. Apple Intelligence is free. So, too, is access to ChatGPT . However, those with paid accounts to the latter will have access to premium features free users don’t. This will, presumably, be a big driver to the already thriving generative AI platform. We know for sure that Apple plans to partner with additional generative AI services. The company all but said that Google Gemini is next on that list ."},

Siri is getting a slew of new features and updates thanks to the addition of Apple Intelligence, the company’s generative AI offering , and a partnership with OpenAI . From ChatGPT integration to the ability to type instead of speak to Siri, there’s a lot of ways Siri will change in the coming months. Here’s a look at what the introduction of Apple Intelligence will allow you to do with the revamped digital assistant. We’ll learn more about Apple’s plans for Siri at its iPhone event that starts at 10 a.m. Monday . We also expect to see new AirPods , a new Apple Watch and perhaps even new Macs. Siri will soon be able to tap into OpenAI’s ChatGPT to answer certain questions. For example, if you need recipe ideas to make a meal using some ingredients from your garden, you can ask Siri, and Siri will automatically feed that info to ChatGPT to generate some options for you. You can include photos with the questions you ask ChatGPT via Siri, or ask questions related to documents or PDFs. For example, say you come across a flower you like while on a walk but don’t know what it’s called. You can take a picture of it and ask Siri what it’s called and where to find it. You won’t need a ChatGPT account, but you will need to grant permission for Siri to tap into the service. With Apple Intelligence, Siri will become aware of your personal context, which means it can take actions that are unique to you. Siri will be able to use the information available on your device to find what you’re looking for. For instance, if you can’t remember whether your friend Alice shared a recipe with you in a text or an email, you can ask Siri to “pull up the recipe that Alice sent a few days ago.” Or, if you quickly need to find your passport number when booking a flight, you can ask Siri to pull it from your email or your images to automatically enter it into a required field. Apple is making it easier for people to communicate with Siri: The assistant is now equipped to better understand natural language. Even if you stumble on your words when talking to Siri, the assistant will still be able to understand you. You can say, for instance, “Siri, set an alarm for, oh wait no, set a timer for 10 minutes. Actually, make that five.” Siri will understand what you’re asking. Plus, you can ask Siri follow-up questions without having to repeat context. For example, if you ask Siri where your next family reunion is going to take place, it will respond with a location. You can then follow-up by asking, “What will the weather be like there?” without having to mention the name of the location. Up until now, you could only communicate with Siri via your voice. With Apple Intelligence, you can type to Siri when you don’t want to speak out loud. You just need to double tap the button on your iPhone or iPad screen to ask Siri any question. The option to type to Siri is handy when you’re in a quiet environment and can’t speak out loud. Or, perhaps you’re in a loud environment; typing to Siri can ensure your inquiry is understood clearly. Siri now has more information about Apple’s products and services, so if you have a question about your Apple device, you can ask Siri for help. That includes how to use a feature for the first time on your iPhone, iPad and Mac. For instance, you can ask Siri how to schedule a text message to send later. Siri will then give you step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Otherwise you’d have to to go into your settings and navigate to a help page if you needed more information about your device. Siri can now understand what’s on your screen and take action based on what you’re currently looking at on your device. For instance, if your friend texts you a new address, you can tell Siri to add the address to their contact card. Or, if your friend suggests a TV show on Apple TV+, you can ask Siri to open it. With Apple Intelligence, Siri can take action in and across apps. You can ask Siri to enhance a photo for you in the Photos app and then ask the digital assistant to send it to a specific person in Messages. You don’t have to open the separate apps or complete the tasks, as Siri will be able to take action in both apps on its own."},

Today, the ride-hail company is doubling down on its docked scooter and bikeshare operations, positioning itself as the ideal partner for cities looking to enhance their urban transportation networks. Since acquiring shared bike and station provider PBSC Urban Solutions two years ago, Lyft has invested in building and deploying better quality e-bikes and docked e-scooters, as well as a new type of docking station that is solar-powered, modular and able to charge both bikes and scooters. As CEO David Risher reviewed Lyft’s micromobility assets, he asked himself: “Do we sell the whole thing, or do we operate it?” “E-bikes in particular are growing so fast globally. It would be insane not to take it on ourselves,” Risher told TechCrunch, noting Lyft’s e-bike rides increased 65% year-over-year through August to make up half of total rides. “So we said, let’s do this ourselves and bring it to the real standard of excellence that we have for our whole business.” Lyft is keeping its micromobility business, but it’s coming at a cost. The company is restructuring its team and finances and laying off about 1% of its workforce on the tech side as the company shifts resources from R&D to sales, operations and deployment, according to a Lyft spokesperson and a regulatory filing. The company disclosed Wednesday morning it will incur about $34 million to $46 million of restructuring and related charges, of which $32 million to $42 million are related to asset disposal costs. The remaining costs will be related to employee severance and benefit costs, and advisory fees, according to a regulatory filing. Lyft will streamline and integrate the two sides of its micromobility business — PBSC, which sells bikeshare-as-a-service to local operators and cities in 49 markets globally, and the eight Lyft-owned and operated bike and scooter share programs, like Citi Bike in New York City and Divvy in Chicago. The combined division will be renamed Lyft Urban Solutions, and Michael Brous, Lyft’s former head of operations, will head it up. “We estimate that the ongoing benefit to the business of this restructuring is going to be on the order of $20 million a year, and it will be a net contributor to the business,” Risher said. It’s still a small portion of the business, which in the second quarter saw revenue of $1.4 billion. But any amount helps to stay in the green — Lyft recorded an operating loss of $27 million in the quarter, much narrower than the year-ago operating loss of $159 million, and actually earned $5 million in net income versus a net loss of $114 million in the year-ago quarter. Lyft’s goal is to slowly update the hardware and software platforms in each city to eventually get to the point of standardization. And Lyft wants to do it in a way that focuses on a station-based, grid-connected approach. That means avoiding dockless scooters and bikes. “We’re really focused on the docked version because it frankly helps cities organize themselves better,” Risher said. “There was a time where it was a free-for-all, let’s just put a bunch of junk on the street, but we thought we should do it in a way that works for riders but also works for cities.” Docked bike and scooter-share also has the added benefit of giving companies like Lyft access to longer-term city partnerships, as stations end up becoming part of a city’s infrastructure. Lyft’s dockless footprint is already small — the company operates scooters in Washington, D.C., alongside its Capital Bikeshare service, as well as bikes and scooters in Denver. Lyft said in a blog post Wednesday that it would discontinue both of those services and explore other options with Denver. But, so as not to miss out on the dockless scooter craze, Lyft will continue to partner with Spin and, as of recently, Bird ( which owns Spin ) so riders can book directly through the Lyft app. Lyft does not break out its micromobility business in quarterly or annual earnings reports, and the company would not share what percentage of its total revenue comes from shared micromobility. That said, the total number of rides Lyft recorded across micromobility and ride-hail hit 709 million in 2023, and about 56.7 million of those, or around 8%, were bike and scooter-share rides. Update: This story was updated to include Wednesday’s SEC filing and include more information on the cost of the restructuring."},

However, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says that the deal — reportedly valued at around $650 million — does fall under its regulatory purview as a “relevant merger situation,” meaning similar deals in the future may still be investigated on competition grounds — even if a full acquisition has not taken place. Microsoft launched a new consumer AI division back in March, which Inflection co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan (respectively, also previously a co-founder and a scientist at Google DeepMind) are spearheading. CEO Satya Nadella confirmed that a number of other Inflection AI members had joined Microsoft’s new AI unit, such as AI scientist Jordan Hoffmann, who is now heading up Microsoft’s U.K. AI hub in London . Back in July, the CMA revealed that it was launching a “phase 1” merger inquiry into the deal, kickstarting an investigation to gather evidence and decide whether to proceed with a full probe. Central to the initial phase was whether the deal could in fact be investigated as a “merger,” given that Microsoft hadn’t actually acquired Inflection AI. And if it did qualify as a merger, whether further action is required to counter competition concerns. At the heart of all this is a growing push by Big Tech companies to circumvent regulatory scrutiny around AI, powered by a new M&A approach that some have dubbed the “ quasi-merger “; this could involve anything from strategic investments, to — as we’ve seen with Microsoft and Inflection — hiring startup founders and technical talent. In its findings, the CMA notes that Microsoft hired “almost all of Inflection’s team,” including two of its founders, while simultaneously entering into a series of commercial agreements such as a nonexclusive licensing deal to use Inflection’s intellectual property (IP). (The exact number was never specified, but reportedly it was around 70 others.) Moreover, the CMA concluded that prior to their hiring, the Inflection team’s self-proclaimed remit was “creating AI for everyone,” but with the lion’s share of the team leaving Inflection, Microsoft had “acquired the team’s collective know-how” to develop its own AI smarts. The CMA writes in its assessment: Given that any technology in this space can quickly become obsolete without ongoing development, the CMA notes the importance of expertise to the development and supply of FMs [foundation models] and chatbots. Based on the evidence seen by the CMA, the team of staff responsible for development is therefore at the core of any business seeking to develop FMs or chatbots. In this context, the CMA considers that acquiring a team with relevant know-how — even without further assets — may fall within the CMA’s merger control jurisdiction. One of the core criteria used in this judgment stems from the U.K.’s Enterprise Act 2002, which helps define what a “relevant merger situation” actually means. This includes whether, as a result of a transaction, “two or more enterprises cease to be distinct.” Although Inflection still exists as a stand-alone business , the heart and brains of the company now lie at Microsoft. And this “value” that Microsoft procured cost it a fairly chunky $650 million, according to a report in The Information from March, a fee it’s paying Inflection substantively to license Inflection’s foundation models and make them available on Microsoft’s Azure cloud. So it’s easy to see why some might view this arrangement as an acquisition in all but name. “The transfer of employees, coupled with other tactical arrangements, mean that two enterprises are no longer distinct,” Joel Bamford, the CMA’s executive director, wrote in a LinkedIn post today . Despite all this, the second facet of the CMA investigation concluded that the transaction didn’t pose any significant competition concerns, owing to the fact that Inflection was not a significant enough competitor to Microsoft’s existing AI tools. “Inflection AI is not a strong competitor to the consumer chatbots that Microsoft has developed directly (Copilot) and in partnership with OpenAI (ChatGPT),” Bamford wrote. “On this basis, we cleared the transaction.” The original Microsoft-Inflection probe constituted one of several similar inquiries announced by the CMA back in April. This included Microsoft’s investment in French startup Mistral AI , with the regulator swiftly concluding that the deal didn’t qualify for investigation under current merger regulations due to the size of the investment. At the same time, the CMA revealed it was looking at Amazon’s ties with Anthropic in the wake of its $4 billion investment into the AI startup — this is now the subject of a formal probe . Elsewhere, the CMA is also inviting interested parties and stakeholders to comment on Google’s ties with Anthropic, after the internet giant invested a reported $300 million last year followed by a further $2 billion . So the main takeaway from all this is that Microsoft may have escaped regulatory intervention on this occasion, but future deals involving Big Tech and smaller startups are very much on the CMA’s radar — regardless of whether a full acquisition has taken place."},
{"category": "Media & Entertainment", "title": "reMarkable’s Paper Pro adds color, light and more but keeps the focus on ‘focus’", "date": "2024-09-04", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/remarkables-paper-pro-adds-color-light-and-more-but-keeps-the-focus-on-focus/", "content": "The new Paper Pro tablet from reMarkable moves the company’s vision of combining PC with paper closer to reality, adding color and capability while keeping the philosophy of focus intact. The Norwegian company has been something of an unlikely success story. In a day and age where more and more functionality is crammed into our devices, reMarkable’s approach of doing a few things well — and largely in black and white — seems almost self-defeating. But despite swimming upstream, the company has prospered, growing and funding itself without resorting to venture capital, something few startups can say. With the first reMarkable tablet, the company established the philosophy of focusing on one document at a time, reading and writing on the device as if it were a piece of paper. The reMarkable 2 significantly improved and streamlined the device , making writing especially much more responsive. The $499 Paper Pro — a new naming convention to indicate it is a higher-end alternative to the now-$379 reMarkable 2, not a direct successor — is momentous for its addition of both color and a “frontlight,” though both features are what you might call muted. I received a device to review, so expect that (as well as our own photos) to follow in due time; I will also be putting some more technical details in a separate piece about the hardware. But for now, here’s the top line on the latest from reMarkable. Color e-paper devices have yet to convince me that the feature is worth the trade-off. For instance, comparing the color and monochrome versions of a Kobo e-reader, anyone can see that the color version is inferior for everyday reading. And color content, while passable, is vastly inferior to how it appears on an ordinary screen. Mats Herding, reMarkable’s hardware lead, explained this succinctly. In reflective screens like e-paper, the pixels are kind of like glasses of milk with Oreos submerged in them. If the cookie is below the surface, the pixel is white(ish); if you make the cookie rise to the top, it’s black. Normally color is added by putting a RGB filter over the top so that the white pixels are colorized — but this also affects resolution and contrast. As Herding explained it, what they’ve done is instead dumped a bunch of Skittles (the American type; taste the rainbow) in the milk. And they can surface the Oreo — or the red Skittles, or the green ones, or whatever — with no hit to resolution or clarity. The color is still muted, and I would not want to read a comic on the device, but the point of adding color is to enrich interactive and creative options. Whereas before you were limited to black and white, you can now highlight, circle, jot and sketch in a handful of distinct colors (they blend but look best in their pure form). Anyone who works with text or mixed media regularly knows how limiting it can be to work with just one color; at the very least it helps with clarity to have a highlighter for important passages and a ballpoint pen for notes. reMarkable’s team is careful to take inspiration from real-world examples, so the software now supports quick switching between two pens, just as any professor or editor marking up a story would have. It’s freeing for anyone who theoretically wanted to edit or mark up documents — design treatments, pitch decks, article layouts, books and all the rest — but it felt limited by the device’s colorless predecessors. The writing experience is, apart from the above, superficially unchanged, but ask Herding and you’ll get the full report on how difficult it was to simultaneously add color and a frontlight, increase the screen size, and further improve the already standard-setting pen/writing experience. Everything, he stressed, more or less had to be developed from scratch, since they didn’t want to compromise on anything (with one exception: weight; something had to give). Just as filter-based color wasn’t an option, existing frontlights and stylus tracking tech weren’t either. The new frontlight is not intended to get past ambient brightness; it’s a replacement for shining a light on the screen, not meant to be a light itself. It’s also locked to a specific color temperature range, because too much change there would cause the color cast to change. That sounds limiting, but really, my experience with e-reader frontlights is that I pick a temperature and a minimal brightness or two and just stick to it. The reMarkable Paper Pro’s screen is a little cooler than I’d like for reading books, but it makes good sense as a virtual piece of paper. There’s a new active stylus that works in synchrony with the screen to provide a sub-20-millisecond response time for producing a line when you write, which is past the inflection point of around 25 to 30 millliseconds that feels good enough and still does seem noticeably better. The pen pointedly has no charging port, and it only collects power by being stuck to the side of the tablet. It’s also more expensive, though, so be careful not to lose it — like I almost did within about two hours of getting my review unit. (The tablet itself charges via USB-C and the company claims a two-week battery life.) One capability that has been more aspirational than functional on the reMarkable 2 is the ability to type on it. As a writer perpetually procrastinating until I get the perfect writing-focused device (people have resorted to creating their own “typedecks” since what’s on the market is generally lacking), I was excited for it but ultimately found the experience lackluster when reMarkable’s otherwise well-done keyboard case debuted last year . The company has thankfully doubled down on the feature rather than allowing it to remain vestigial, and there is a new typing case for the Paper Pro and a redone typing/mixed-media experience that acknowledges the capricious and complex needs of writers: things like selecting text, copying and pasting, writing in the margins — you know, real high-tech stuff. There’s even a dedicated key for switching between sketching and highlighting and editor-type actions like selecting and shifting. I only very lightly tested the new Paper Pro in its capacity as typedeck (having received the device before a long weekend, with the announcement immediately following it), but I’m optimistic this time. The type looks better, there are more options in-line, the interface is more robust, and I can actually edit my work. The keyboard itself has been improved as well, though I haven’t had time to directly compare to the original. (Again, a review is forthcoming.) The new reMarkable tablet is still in many ways a hard sell. The company has not, as I had hoped, identified a handful of services like Pocket, Notes or what have you, to be a syncing partner; you still have to live and work within the reMarkable ecosystem and export it to those apps or services. reMarkable’s team said they have improved and sped up that process, however, and made numerous improvements to the app and other systems. This is, however, not out of a perverse desire to cultivate a walled garden but a justified rejection of what the company sees outside those walls. The entire idea of the reMarkable devices is that they do not constantly connect; they don’t notify you of things; you don’t just consume — you interact or create. There’s no app for that. If you want those things, you get a laptop or an iPad, like you probably already have. If, however, the idea of a more focused digital creative experience appeals to you, the Paper Pro is a major evolution of that. Is it worth the $500-plus sticker price — nearly $900 if you add the Marker Plus and keyboard case? If it can get me to finish some of the dozens of stories I’ve got bouncing around in my head, it’s an easy yes for me (but that’s probably a personal problem). But for others it’s a hard no right off the bat if it doesn’t support YouTube or Spotify, or what have you. The company has found enough buyers so far (and enough that subscribe to the Connect data syncing service) that it’s been able to survive and thrive in a competitive device market. The improvements in the Paper Pro are likely to continue that trend, even if it is often people like me who want to use the device more than we actually do. Over the next couple weeks, I’ll be seeing if I can change that."},

But Google has a lot easier time answering queries with a single, simple answer, such as “how many is a dozen?” than it does answering complex questions like “what influence did Thomas Paine’s ‘Common Sense’ have on Enlightenment ideals?” That’s why You.com is betting the company on answering the second type of question. Emboldened by a new $50 million funding round, the consistently innovative yet often overlooked AI company aims to excel where other AI companies raising billions falter. As founder and CEO Richard Socher puts it: “Just from first principles, where can you be 10x better than Google?” It would be futile to compete on the simple questions that make up the vast bulk of Google searches — basic facts, conversions and references. “But people willing to pay for You.com are people that do productive knowledge work,” Socher says. “And this is actually where the sweet spot, where the killer app for this technology is: making this productivity engine, telling these agents when and how to search the internet.” While the term “productivity engine” may not be immediately intuitive, the idea is that you will be able to employ natural language to tell the system what you want to know, whatever the complexity, in the same way you might tell a human assistant. (It’s agent-adjacent but not the same thing.) For instance, say you wanted to catch up on the side effects of a new drug. You could tell the system, “Summarize the literature around acute side effects of flimflamazone.” A language model probably can’t answer this kind of question off the cuff. It’s entirely possible it’s never heard of flimflamazone — in which case, it might admit its lack of knowledge, or it might hallucinate an answer. Even if it does have some knowledge of the drug, it’s likely not up to date. You.com is focusing on this kind of more demanding task, where the query itself needs to be examined first so the agent can arm itself with the proper information and techniques. In this case, it would need to go online and score a few papers. Importantly, for this kind of research, citations will be deep-linked and in context. So when you see a claim or figure, it will have a clickable citation that not only takes you to the source document, but also highlights the relevant text for you. Socher also showed me an example of asking the model to estimate how much someone should invest in an index fund when their kid turns one, in order to ensure the fund grows to cover their Stanford tuition. Explaining its process step by step, the model said first that it needed to perform searches to find out the average yield of a compound-interest fund, the average cost of a Stanford education and the average age someone goes to college, plus inflation and some other stuff. Using those as its assumptions, it sketched out a Python script to calculate how much different seed amounts would grow, and ultimately arrived at a reasonable answer (about $51,000, if you’re wondering). You could get Claude or ChatGPT to do something similar. In fact, You.com relies on these and other models for its LLM capabilities. But Claude, for instance, would not be able to go and find new documents to reference. And ChatGPT is less painstaking about its sources and process. Socher said that You.com’s goal is to get it right the first time, every time, by carefully controlling which models are prompted and how. He also showed a demonstration of what he called “multiplayer” AI — essentially a shared AI workspace where multiple users can add documents, summarize or ask questions about them and do other “productivity engine” type tasks, but with full visibility to others. Socher said that You.com’s services compared favorably business-wise too. While others are racing to the bottom, he’s moving up the food chain and adding paying customers left and right — You.com has five times more subscribers now than it did at the start of the year. “Companies are raising money so they can give away their product for free, and ads haven’t really been figured out for chat,” he said. “We’ve been more careful about this, and we think it’s time for us to scale.” He wouldn’t name any names, but said some large companies essentially use You.com to handle certain queries their own systems get. One can imagine a large company offering certain automation services but having internal models or APIs that can only handle so much — if You.com is more expensive but gets the job done, it has a place in their stack. Socher did make the outlook seem rosy, and apparently investors agree. The $50 million B round was led by Georgian, with participation from Day One Ventures, DuckDuckGo, Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures and SBVA (formerly Softbank Ventures Asia). The amount was slightly less when I talked with Socher; you know it’s a hot round when a few million get added to it while you’re writing the article. Though the round is inarguably large, it may appear insignificant compared to those being raised by You.com’s billion-dollar competitors. But with swelling employee numbers, eye-popping hardware investments and server bills to pay, the run rate of those companies is astronomical. The strategy appears to be that they are frontloading the cost of inventing the market — and they may well succeed, but the sticker price is in the 10-figure range. But You.com is making money, at least from some companies, right now. “The unit economies for large enterprise deals are positive — and some companies are using us millions of times per day,” he said. The idea that AI shouldn’t cost hundreds of millions just to exist seems novel today, but if You.com can make this play, it may just catch on."},

One of the reasons this industry is so lucrative is because the majority of people who bet on sports lose. A three-year-old Chicago-based startup called DubClub is trying to change that. “When betting on sports, you are at a structural disadvantage versus the sportsbooks,” DubClub co-founder and CEO Ryan Gaertner, told TechCrunch. “They have more data than the average person. Those companies make money when people lose.” DubClub hopes to help amateur bettors win more by finding experts that may help them better understand which bets to make. DubClub is a platform where amateur sports bettors can subscribe to professional “cappers,” a gambling industry term for people that research and pick winners using their own handicapping systems. Cappers are in a profession as old as gambling itself, and also ripe for scams. But DubClub says it vets these sports content creators. Users receive their information through text, email or Discord. Gaertner said that the idea behind DubClub came from a conversation he overheard between co-founders Andrew Daschbach and Lewis Burik. Daschbach wanted to get better information to help him find an edge while sports betting. He found handicappers online that were willing to share their picks, but finding these handicappers was fragmented, the payment process was sketchy and it was hard to avoid scams. Gaertner figured Daschbach wasn’t the only one with this problem. “Cappers really wanted to get paid, and they were already getting paid for their advice, but the system was archaic,” Gaertner said. “It felt like the perfect place for us to build a product and a network that brings both sides together.” Gaertner said they spent six months working with these sports betting content creators to build a platform that they’d be willing to adopt. The company launched in 2021 and says it has since seen more than 1 million subscribers on its platforms, with some users being consistently subscribed to certain cappers for more than a year straight. DubClub just raised a $7.5 million Series A round led by Renegade Partners. Gaertner said DubClub isn’t a particularly capital-intensive business and they didn’t need to raise. He added that the raise is so DubClub can build a better tech stack and website — Gaertner said he can acknowledge their tech is good now but not great — and needed the capital to hire engineers and product people. Roseanne Wincek, a co-founder and managing director at Renegade Partners, said she got introduced to the company through Tripp Jones, a partner at Uncork Capital, which led the company’s seed round. The pair were trapped at the airport waiting on a delayed flight when Wincek asked Jones her favorite question for fellow VCs: “What is your favorite investment?” Jones said DubClub and Wincek decided to look into it despite not knowing much about the space. “We tend to have a good amount of vertical SaaS in our portfolio and I think you don’t often think about handicappers as a vertical, but it is this consumer trend with that creator layer on top of it,” Wincek said. “It’s one of those lightning-in-a-bottle markets. It’s $10 billion. It’s supposed to be like $30 billion in a few years.” Despite the growth potential in sports betting, it is an interesting sector for DubClub to be building in. While it has the potential to be a huge market, this is also a polarizing space. A lot of consumers and investors don’t want to be associated with the gambling industry due to its ties to addiction. Some investors also actually can’t touch it due to vice clauses, which LPs set to prevent their GPs from backing certain types of businesses. While DubClub is not a betting platform itself, Gaertner said he’s conscious of this industry’s perception. He doubled down that DubClub is a platform for users that bet on sports as a hobby, not a career, and that they track how much money their users are spending. He added that they are looking into adding guardrails and guides that could set limits for how much money people can spend on the platform. But that’s why this area is polarizing: Setting limits may be the right thing to do — but limiting usage could have a negative impact on the company’s bottom line. DubClub isn’t the only company connecting handicappers with sports betters either. BetFirm is another, as is SportsCapping . Gaertner thinks DubClub’s current subscription business is just the beginning. He wants to eventually add features where users will be able to discuss different bets almost like a social media company. But for now, football season starts this weekend. “It’s not about winning. It’s about winning more together,” Gaertner said. This piece has been updated to correct that DubClub is based in Chicago not San Francisco."},

Even enterprises with robust data analytics and orchestration tools seemed to be having a rough go of it, Agrawal and Gupta say. Maybe so. According to a Deloitte study , 67% of managers aren’t comfortable accessing insights from data analytics platforms, partly due to tech-related challenges. “Everyone wants to be strategic, but current approaches keep companies trapped in firefighting mode, grappling with routine, preventable operational and tactical tasks,” Agrawal told TechCrunch. “Companies need a modern approach to address their expanding roles and drive business success.” And, wouldn’t you know, Agrawal and Gupta say they’ve developed exactly this “modern approach” and built it into Revefi , a software-as-a-service platform (and startup of the same name) they co-launched in 2021. Revefi connects to a company’s data stores and databases (e.g. Snowflake, Databricks and so on) and attempts to automatically detect and troubleshoot data-related issues; it also makes suggestions as to how these various resources might be optimized. “Revefi enables data teams to be more strategic,” Agrawal said, “and deliver the right data at the right time at the right cost to businesses.” Agrawal and Gupta assert that Revefi can help accomplish things like delivering a unified view of a company’s data operations and decreasing storage bills by performing an analysis of cost and quality across different providers. One customer was able to reduce their cloud data platform costs by 30% using Revefi, Agrawal claims. “We have replaced and won against Monte Carlo , Acceldata , Anomalo , Informatica and other data observability and data quality products,” Agrawal said. Bold claims! Asked how many clients Revefi has at present, Agrawal declined to say. But he did reveal that several “large enterprises” are paying for Revefi’s services, including a “$5 billion public security company” and “$10 billion public data company.” (Perhaps revealingly, Revefi lists ThoughtSpot in the case studies section of its website.) Seattle-based Revefi, which this week closed a $20 million Series A funding round led by Icon Ventures with participation from Mayfield, GTM Capital and StepStone Group, plans to greatly expand its product and 30-person team in the coming year. To date, the startup has raised $29 million. “Enterprises are struggling with the explosive growth in and variety of data, the proliferation of data tools and complexity and out-of-control data spending,” Agrawal said. “We’re benefiting from this; we are in a high-growth phase and are hiring AI, engineering, sales and marketing talent. We are agile, manage our costs efficiently and have a pragmatic approach to growth.”"},

Companies in its first portfolio include the e-commerce platform The Folklore Group and the food logistics company Prado. “We’re investing in a way that’s a bit more representative of the shifting demographics in this country.” Much has changed since Slauson & Co. partners Relan and Austin Clements launched their venture fund in 2020. At the time, the duo wanted one thing: to back early-stage founders, focused on SaaS and consumer tech. There was no Ivy League or Silicon Valley resume focus: founders could be anyone. Many came from underrepresented backgrounds. The firm ended up closing a $75 million Fund I (more than its target of $50 million, with investors including Ron Conway) and backed 38 companies, most of which are helmed by people of color and at least half of which are led by women. Fast-forward to today, Slauson & Co. remains even more committed to the mission of inclusivity in its funding, and it seems limited partners have its back . Clements and Relan said they spent nearly a year raising the second fund, given venture’s economic dip and the harder sell these days for funds focused on social good (or anything other than AI). They met with hundreds of investors and landed around 40. In fact, Fund II actually has fewer limited partners than Fund I, despite the higher amount. Relan said the biggest shifts have been with corporate initiatives, which accounted for around a third of the firm’s Fund I, but have fallen out of favor in 2024. “As the tides have shifted, in some ways we anticipated the pendulum might swing back in the other direction,” Clements said, referring to the current climate of less support for backing founders from underrepresented backgrounds. Obviously, the key was proving the performance of the firm’s thesis, so that limited partners want to back them regardless of the social climate. “What we really wanted was just for people to look at us for the merits of what we can achieve and the opportunity that we’re going after,” Clements continued. “That seemed to resonate with folks.” Standouts from Slauson & Co.’s portfolio include The Folklore Group, which recently announced the close of a $3.4 million seed round, and Pressed Roots, which announced a $3.1 million seed from investors earlier this year. On a brighter note, more institutional investors backed Slauson and Co. this round, which the duo is excited about. While corporate initiatives accounted for less than 1% of Fund II, many of the fund’s other original investors returned. Relan said that Fund I hit all the targets they said it would. “We achieved the target ownership we were going after. We invested at the pace of deployment we said that we would,” he continued. “We stuck to our guns and wanted to be very disciplined. And I think that’s paid off with LPs.” Fund II will write checks between $500,000 and $2 million, hoping to lead most rounds. It will make 30 investments out of this fund throughout the next three years, with capital reserved for follow-up rounds. It has already started investing out of Fund II. Clements and Relan have always said that they are looking within the ocean of overlooked opportunities for the next founders to reel in. Since founding their VC firm, they’ve launched an accelerator program, hosted summer camps for portfolio companies and built a network of operators and investors to support their founders. “We like to say there is a Slauson Avenue in every major city across the country and we want to build a brand and firm that represents those types of communities,” Relan said. And, if they do their jobs right, “hopefully folks with way deeper pockets than ours, who may not necessarily care about the same things that we care about, see an economic opportunity and start fishing in the same ocean.”"},

When Mayfield raised a $955 million fund last year, Chaddha told TechCrunch the firm didn’t need a multibillion-dollar fund because “copying somebody else is strategy for disaster, strategy for failure.” The firm is again trying to do something that it sees as unique. On Wednesday, Mayfield said it is launching AI Garage, a $100 million initiative for ideation-stage founders interested in building “AI teammate” companies. AI Garage wants to distinguish itself from accelerators such as YC or pre-seed programs like Sequoia’s Arc or Greylock’s Edge by modeling the effort on its entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) experience. For the past 40 years, Mayfield Fund has hired one or two EIRs each year and helped them turn a raw concept into a new, fundable company. With the new program, Mayfield plans to scale and formalize its EIR program by welcoming up to five aspiring founders into its office every six months. Just like with EIRs, AI Garage participants won’t receive capital on day one, but Mayfield will allocate a minimum of $1 million and as much as $5 million as soon as the business plan is hatched with the help of a firm’s partners and other support staff, including marketing, talent and business development team. As for why Mayfield decided to quintuple and formalize its EIR program, the answer comes down to Chaddha’s interest in getting early access to AI application startups, specifically in the area he calls “AI teammates.” “They haven’t even started the company. We will help them start it,” Chaddha said. According to Chaddha, AI teammates differ from copilots and agents because they are more than simple assistants, which can answer questions or perform actions autonomously, like booking meetings or offering refunds. “Teammates collaborate with humans on complex tasks to achieve a shared goal,” he said. “AI teammates are digital companions that elevate humans to superhumans. They are going to take us into a new era of collaborative intelligence.” Although the terms “copilot,” “agent” and “teammate” can be used interchangeably, labeling an AI app as a teammate can be seen as a clever marketing tactic because it just seems more human-friendly. “We believe there are endless opportunities for AI teammates to collaborate with humans and to shape the future of our workplace by having AI work together with humans in many areas, including product and engineering, data, sales and marketing, customer service, IT and security, finance, HR, legal and many administrative functions,” Chaddha said. Mayfield has already invested in nearly a dozen AI teammate companies, including DevRev (customer service support AI), Docket (an AI sales engineer) and NeuBird (site reliability AI engineer.) In NeuBird’s case, human site reliability engineers tell its AI to detect any site outages, and then triage and troubleshoot problems. If the AI discovers it can’t fix the problem, it calls human engineers for help. “That’s an example of a teammate,” Chaddha said."},

Claude Enterprise will compete with OpenAI’s business-specific solution, ChatGPT Enterprise , released roughly a year ago. Claude Enterprise allows businesses to upload proprietary company knowledge into Anthropic’s AI chatbot. Then Claude can analyze the information, answer questions about it, create graphics and simple web pages, or act as a company-specific AI assistant. Anthropic appears to be playing catch-up with OpenAI, trying to put Claude everywhere that ChatGPT already is. The startup has released a few ways to use Claude that closely match how OpenAI already offers ChatGPT. “The reality is that Claude has been usable for companies for a year. Candidly, we’ve had a product in the market for a lot less long,” Anthropic product lead Scott White told TechCrunch. “But we’re responding to the needs of our customers at a high velocity with a smaller team.” In May, Anthropic released the Claude Team plan which, much like the ChatGPT team plan, allowed small businesses to collaborate on projects. Since the spring, Anthropic has launched Claude mobile apps for iOS and Android. Now, it’s going up against ChatGPT Enterprise, which has seen widespread adoption among Fortune 500 companies. But Anthropic’s enterprise offering is different from what’s on the market in a few key ways. First, the context window on Claude Enterprise is 500,000 tokens, meaning Anthropic’s models can process up to 200,000 lines of code, dozens of 100-page documents or a two-hour audio transcript in a single prompt. ChatGPT Enterprise and Claude’s Team plan offer context windows less than half that. Claude Enterprise comes with Projects and Artifacts, Anthropic’s workspaces where several users can upload and edit content. These features could be useful in business cases, where you might be working on a longer project with lots of data sources and people involved. The Enterprise plan also includes GitHub integration for engineering teams to sync their GitHub repositories with Claude. Coding has become a popular use case for Claude Sonnet 3.5, and this integration means that Anthropic’s models can have direct access to its customers’ codebases. This can be useful for catching a new engineer up to speed, creating a new feature or solving a bug, for instance. Like ChatGPT’s Enterprise plan, Claude Enterprise allows businesses to assign a primary owner for your company’s workspace. That owner can assign different levels of access to projects and information within Claude, and trace activity across the system for security and compliance monitoring. Also like OpenAI, Anthropic says it is not training on Claude Enterprise customer data. That’s important for many businesses that don’t want their trade secrets ending up in Claude or ChatGPT’s knowledge base six months from now. Anthropic refused to disclose the price of Claude Enterprise, though White said it’s more expensive than Anthropic’s Team plan (which costs $30 per month, per member). White said that’s because Enterprise customers get a lot more mileage out of Claude, with larger context windows and higher rate limits. (For what it’s worth, OpenAI won’t publicly disclose the price of its enterprise product either.) White says Anthropic has been working in a private beta for months with early adopters such as GitLab, Midjourney, IG Group and Menlo Ventures (an investor in Anthropic). However, gaining broader adoption will be key. AI model developers like Anthropic have faced pressure to sell API access at lower and lower prices . Products like Claude Enterprise offer a path to revenue, however, widespread adoption is needed to offset the expensive inference costs that come with them. It’s not clear that any AI model developers are profiting off of these business-specific plans just yet."},

Founded in 2007, Dutch firm SET Ventures is one of the latter. Its fourth fund, which just closed at €200 million, is twice the size of its previous one, and will be deployed into 20 to 25 European startups making renewable energy more mainstream. SET’s name, pronounced “set,” stands for Sustainable Energy Technologies. Its long track record of investing in European climate-focused startups and Article 9 status , which requires a commitment to sustainability as a goal, helped it attract more capital than ever from a mix of corporate and institutional LPs. But managing partner Anton Arts is aware that a larger fund can drive early-stage firms toward writing larger checks at later stages, driving them away from their area of expertise. SET plans to avoid this pitfall “by doing more deals, not doing different deals,” he told TechCrunch. This means steering clear of making late-stage investments, except as follow-ons. “Our sweet spot is Series A, where we’ll write initial checks between €2 and €5 million,” Arts said. One recent example is German digital heat management startup Vilisto , which raised a €5 million Series A round from SET and others. Check size won’t change, but SET’s thesis did evolve over the years to veer toward the digital side of things. “For this fourth fund,” Arts said, “we have formulated our mission to invest in the digital technologies that are needed for the carbon-free energy system.” This makes SET different from World Fund, for instance: Danijel Višević, a managing partner at this climate-focused firm that recently closed a €300 million first fund , told TechCrunch that Europe was not concentrating enough on hardware for climate. In contrast, Arts believes that “hardware is, on its own, not going to achieve urgent climate goals.” SET is still willing to invest in companies with a hardware element as long as the science works. Case in point: Its portfolio company Instagrid, which develops enterprise-grade portable chargers, went on to raise a $95 million Series C earlier this year. But it believes there are a lot of interesting and potentially high-upside challenges to be solved in software, too, especially when the goal is to bring innovation to a larger audience — that can only be accomplished through automation, which relies heavily on software. “Early adopters are tinkerers, but mass markets need automation; that’s where AI and other things play a role,” Arts said. Partners René Savelsberg and Wouter Jonk were arguably early adopters when they founded SET Ventures in Amsterdam in 2007. Arts joined them seven years ago, and sees similarities between “everything that’s going on around the energy transition” and emerging technologies he witnessed go mainstream in earlier phases of his career in VC and software since the nineties. Whether it’s 5G, adtech or internet infrastructure, he sees all sorts of parallels worth drawing. According to Arts, this is also where founders with expertise from other sectors can help apply their learnings to climate startups. This is happening more and more, and he is here for it. “What’s super important for us is that they bring their playbooks, they bring their networks, they bring their conviction, and I think it really all adds to this energy and momentum in the sector.” With more founders working on clean energy, SET Ventures also saw the need to widen its net. For a long time, it had a single office in Amsterdam; but a couple years ago, it added another one in Germany. This matches the fact that most of its investments so far have been in the Netherlands, U.K. and DACH region. “We do believe that with this bigger fund, we’ll be able to increase our geographical coverage,” Arts said."},

Dubbed Spotter Studio , the solution aims to support YouTubers throughout the creative process, such as helping them brainstorm video concepts, generate thumbnail and title ideas, plan projects, organize tasks and collaborate with their team. Most notably, it has a feature that analyzes billions of publicly available YouTube videos in order to draw inspiration from similar creators. Spotter Studio competes with various AI tools designed for creators, including TubeBuddy and vidIQ, as well as YouTube’s AI-powered inspiration tool , which suggests topics based on data about what viewers are currently watching. However, Spotter Studio claims to differ from other tools because its solution is more tailored to individual preferences. When creators sign up for Spotter Studio, they give it permission to access all of their publicly available YouTube videos. The company then uses these videos to provide custom suggestions that resonate with their audiences. The company says it doesn’t share the users’ personalized recommendations with others. “It’s looking at every video you’ve ever created and can see what has really worked for you and what has not worked for you,” Spotter founder and CEO Aaron DeBevoise explained to TechCrunch. “That data, plus the kind of performance data around the channel in general, will tailor every recommendation to that creator. So, [when] we have a situation where we have four creators, and they all enter in the same idea, they will all get different results based on who they are.” Spotter’s “Brainstorm” feature generates ideas based on the creator’s prompt and what they’ve created in the past. There are also override options to customize the results even further. For instance, there’s an option to describe the target audience. So, if the majority of viewers are male, creators can ask for ideas that target a female and non-binary audience. There’s also a “Diversify” button that allows users to click on a generated idea and branch out into new, related yet different, ideas. For instance, if the topic is basketball, it can generate ideas for a collaboration with basketball players, a basketball competition or a personal story about basketball. Its thumbnail tool is also personalized to each creator. It takes a creator’s profile image and uses their likeness to generate thumbnail concept art. Additionally, Spotter Studio’s “Projects” tool acts as an all-in-one project planner for organizing tasks and collaborating with teams. It also tracks projects throughout the different stages, from in development, post-production, ready to publish and published. Interestingly, the AI also analyzes more than two billion top-performing videos on YouTube made by similar creators to offer Spotter users recommendations on how to boost their own videos. The feature, called “Outliers,” acts as a “research copilot,” taking videos from other YouTubers that a creator’s audience is also watching. Users can click on a title, and Spotter’s AI tool will brainstorm ideas for their channel. The practice of analyzing popular videos on YouTube may raise concerns about originality and creativity. Plagiarism is a significant issue among YouTubers, with many trying to publish as many videos as possible to quickly gain a large following. Last year , Harris Brewis ( a.k.a. hbomberguy ) called out multiple YouTubers for plagiarism. One of the accused was James Somerton, who was alleged to have taken excerpts from authors without proper attribution and reorganized words to present them as his original thoughts. When speaking with Spotter’s EVP of product, Paul Bakaus, we mentioned the Outliers feature could be controversial among some creators. He told TechCrunch, “Creators are already [copying] every day, so that ship has sailed…That’s probably not the best response.” Although an unexpected answer from an executive, his statement is unfortunately correct. Replicating something that’s already successful has been done for decades and will likely never stop. Plus, while YouTube videos themselves are protected by copyright, the underlying idea and concept aren’t. Bakaus claims the system doesn’t generate ideas that directly rip off the other person’s video. However, it doesn’t reflect well to launch an AI tool that replicates what many creators are concerned about. “We are very careful in the brainstorming and the underlying functionality here to never copy the actual video. So, if you hit a brainstorm icon on one of those buttons, the video ideas that you’re getting are never actually the video that you just clicked on. Currently, we only use the title for inspiration, and we always make sure that it’s extremely personalized,” he added. Spotter has been developing the AI tools for about a year now and has invited several creators to test them out, including Colin & Samir , Dude Perfect, Kinigra Deon , MrBeast , Rebecca Zamolo and others. During early beta testing, results showed an average of 49% increase in views in the first week compared to videos made without Spotter Studio, the startup claims. The company says that the suite of AI tools will keep evolving, and Spotter Studio will receive new features every week while improving its current ones. Spotter is also introducing experimental features through its AI arm Spotter Labs. One is a “Story Beats” tool that provides outline help for content. Spotter Studio is available now in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Australia and costs $49 per month. The company is currently offering a limited-time discount of $299 per year. There’s also a free 30-day trial."},

This year, we’re expecting a massive turnout of 10,000 leaders from the startup and VC community. As part of the program, we’re thrilled to unveil the complete agenda for the Builders Stage . It’s the culmination of months of hard work and just one of six stages featured at this year’s event, with many more announcements on the horizon. The Builders Stage serves as a hub for dozens of panels and interviews dedicated to the essential elements of building and financing tech startups. This year, we’re doubling down on our commitment to providing top-tier programming featuring innovation across all stages of a team’s journey. Expect deep dives into operations, talent acquisition, fundraising, and other crucial topics tailored for the new wave of startup pioneers. Plus, don’t miss sessions such as “How to Find, and Keep, Product-Market Fit,” “What You Need to Raise a Series A Today,” “When to Cash Out, When to Keep Fighting” and so many more. with Alex Pall (Mantis VC), Drew Taggart (Mantis VC), and Dan Lorenc (Chainguard) While a lot of celebrities invest in startups, the Chainsmokers are different. Instead of angel investing, Drew Taggart and Alex Pall launched a formal fund, Mantis Venture Capital ; invest out of a formal closed-end fund; and back companies in industries their celebrity prowess can’t always help in, like security startups and analytics platforms. In this session, Taggart and Pall will be joined by Dan Lorenc, the founder of Chainguard, to talk about how they are an asset to their B2B startups. with Renata Quintini ( Renegade Partners ), Corinne Riley ( Greylock ) and Elizabeth Yin ( Hustle Fund ) If you aren’t building the next foundation model AI company, raising a Series A today is likely harder than it has been in some time. To help founders building at the seed stage prepare for their first lettered round, we have investors explain what they — and their firms — are looking for in their next Series A deals. with Spenser Skates ( Amplitude ), April Underwood ( Adverb ) and Tamar Yehoshua ( Glean ) Every startup knows that they need to find product-market fit. But once they do find true resonance between what they are offering and what there is demand for, how should a startup ensure that they do not lose the product-market fit they have gained? Finding PMF is one thing; maintaining it is another. with Martin Casado ( Andreessen Horowitz ) Martin Casado has lived the experience that every founder dreams of. He invented a new technology that radically altered the way computer networks are built and sold his startup for $1.26 billion when it was barely out of stealth (the second startup he sold). He’s since gone on to have an influential career as a VC at Andreessen Horowitz, leading its infrastructure investment practice. He’s now sounding the alarm on AI regulation saying that startups, in particular, need to get involved. with Paul Lambert ( Quilt ), Gurinder Nagra ( Furno Materials ) and Brigid O’Brien ( RA Capital ) Founders seldom have the luxury of entering an empty market, but what happens when the incumbents are unusually entrenched? What does it take to start a company in an industry dominated by big players and technologies that have barely changed in recent years? Hear from two founders and an investor about the trials of taking on multinational conglomerates while building hardware and preparing for scale. with Eti Lazarian (Elle Family Office) and Bruce Lee ( Keebeck Wealth Management ) Family offices have gotten increasingly active in investing in startups both directly and through their VC investors. But what are they looking for? While no two family offices are the same, this session will dig into family office investing trends and where they have been spending time in the startup ecosystem. We’ll also dive into what kind of risk these investors are looking to take on and what makes a startup a good fit for this category of backer. with Rebecca Gevalt ( Dcode Capital ), Topher Haddad ( Albedo ) and Kai Kloepfer ( Biofire ) One fascinating trend these days is an area that has many names: national-interest startups, American dynamism, New World. These startups are creating technologies in areas that are meant to be built, used, and create jobs in the country of origin, like the U.S. They cover everything from aerospace and critical infrastructure to government, manufacturing and national safety. This panel will dig into how far — and how fast — Silicon Valley can rebuild a nation’s foundations. with Areeb Malik ( Glacier ), Hyuk-Jeen Suh ( SkyRiver Ventures ) and Allison Wolff ( Vibrant Planet ) Startup work and venture capital investing are usually judged through the lens of their financial results. The bigger a startup gets, the more it’s worth. But some upstart tech companies are also working on making the world better while making money. So we want to know how far the “doing good” can go while not giving up on the critical “making money” side of building tech companies. with Andy Dunn (Bonobos, Pie) Everyone knows that it is stressful to build a company. And it’s just as commonly known that endless chronic work can lead to burnout. So, why don’t we talk more about founder mental health? Now that our culture is more comfortable discussing mental health in general, it’s time we brought the topic to Disrupt 2024 for a thorough interrogation. with Heather Doshay ( SignalFire ), Lauren Illovsky ( CapitalG ) and Roger Lee ( Comprehensive.io ) Gone are the days when recruiters seemed more plentiful than leaves in the wind; employees in nearly every startup function are therefore facing a more conservative labor market. How can founders capitalize on their increased labor buying power while also treating their staff with respect and retaining key talent? Founders, take note, this one is for you. with Pegah Ebrahimi ( FPV Ventures ), Matt Rogers ( Mill ) and Natalie Sportelli ( Bullish ) What’s the difference between true opportunity and hype? Answering that question correctly is the difference between success and failure in the tech industry. And it’s a far more difficult question than it might appear. When everyone is convinced a specific tech is the future, founders — and even VCs — tend to pursue that tech en mass. But as anyone who’s been through a Valley boom-and-bust cycle knows, collective excitement — hype — isn’t the best indicator. with Sofia Dolfe ( Index Ventures ), Deena Shakir ( Lux Capital ) and Marcie Vu ( Greycroft ) An articulate, alluring pitch presentation is a big part of successful fundraising, and yet it’s relatively uncommon for founders to get candid feedback on how they communicated the problem, their solution and their path to success. During the Pitch Deck Teardown on October 30, VCs will offer their live feedback on decks submitted by audience members. with Nikhil Basu Trivedi ( Footwork ), Dayna Grayson ( Construct Capital ), Elliott Robinson ( Bessemer Venture Partners ) Ideas such as you need $100 million worth of trailing revenue to go public, and $1 million worth of annual recurring revenue to raise a Series A are so old that they are practically perched atop Abe Lincoln’s head. In today’s market, what a startup needs to raise depends on its sector, founder profile, and, yes, momentum. So what do you need to raise that Series A? with Wassym Bensaid ( Rivian ) Rivian’s chief software officer Wassym Bensaid knows a thing or two about building a product from scratch in a high-stakes environment. The software and systems engineering veteran played a central role in Rivian’s recent push to drive down costs while improving its EVs. It was a massive and existential effort that led the EV maker to rework the guts of the vehicles, including the electrical architecture and a redesigned software user interface. It wasn’t always easy. Learn from Bensaid on what it takes to build a product from scratch, including how to navigate conflict and challenges — an essential tool for any startup founder. with Arian Simone ( Fearless Fund ) Fearless Fund is one of many organizations facing the heat for having programs focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. As a result, the future of many of these initiatives is uncertain. But the fight isn’t over yet. Join us for a fireside chat about what happens when civil rights comes to venture capital, only at this year’s Disrupt. with Aeva Black ( Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ), Luis Villa ( Tidelift ) and Bogomil Balkansky ( Sequoia Capital ) Open source software is everywhere and in everything. Many startups are pursuing explicitly open source business models. But every company out there that builds software has at least some dependency on open source code. Recent security issues, however, have made it plain that open source software is a target for state-level hackers. So, how can we keep building and using code that is built communally, but without the risk of back doors and other security holes? with Naveen Rao ( Databricks ), Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan ( Snowflake ) and Dharmesh Thakker ( Battery Ventures ) Startup founders are often presented with the chance to sell their companies before they reach full maturity. In today’s world with IPOs often delayed past historical norms, it may be tempting for founders to look for a parent company for their startups. But when does it make sense to sell, and when should a founder keep blazing their own path? This agenda is just for the Builders Stage . We’ll have five additional stages focusing on AI, SaaS, fintech, space, and much more. Don’t miss the chance to gain invaluable insights from top industry experts at Disrupt 2024.

The social media platform now allows followers to comment on each other’s Stories, making the experience more community-focused, akin to livestreaming where users can engage in larger discussions. A few users have already spotted the feature, including marketing strategist Taylor Loren (@taylor.loren on Threads). Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also posted a screenshot in the company’s Channel (see below). Instagram notes that users will be able to disable the option to have comments posted on their Stories, if they prefer. The new feature seems to have been inspired by user behavior. Instagram head, Adam Mosseri , has previously expressed how the Stories format is one of the app’s most popular features and is more widely used than posting content to the main feed. Private messaging is also highly favored by many users who prefer engaging in closed groups with their friends. The addition of public comments to Stories is part of Instagram’s ongoing efforts to increase engagement on the platform. Most recently, the company added the ability to add music to profiles. There’s also a new feature called “Reveal” that allows users to hide Stories so that followers can only see them after sending a DM."},

This week, we’re looking at a new real estate startup that’s making big waves with its offering, Klarna and Affirm’s financials, a neobank focused on immigrants that’s growing fast, and more! To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important fintech stories delivered to your inbox every Tuesday at 8:00 a.m. PT, subscribe here . There’s a whole lot of fintech in the real estate world. And last week, I got the scoop on a new startup called Landian that emerged from stealth to take advantage of recent rule changes related to real estate commissions. In fact, one of its co-founders is also one of the people who successfully sued the National Association of Realtors (NAR) to help facilitate those changes. Buyers have the option to pay à la carte for Landian’s offering: $49 for each home tour and $199 for an offer prep session or they can commit to paying a flat fee of $1,799 for up to five home tours and two offer prep sessions. Digital brokerage Redfin had some thoughts about the flat fee model, which you can read about here . Buy now, pay later players Klarna and Affirm shared their latest financials last week, and both had pretty impressive results. Affirm blew away analysts’ expectations of a loss per share of 51 cents by notching a loss of 14 cents per share. Its revenue was up 48% year-over-year to $659 million U.S., which was also above analysts’ estimates. Its stock surged on the performance, closing August 30 at $44.01 a share, up significantly from the $31.58 it had closed just two days prior. Meanwhile, Klarna told TechCrunch its revenue increased 27% in the first half of 2024 while adjusted operating expenses remained flat. In other Klarna news, Klarna’s board is mulling over the removal of Mikael Walther, “a confidant of founding partner Victor Jacobsson,” according to the Financial Times . Comun , a digital bank focused on serving immigrants in the United States, has raised $21.5 million in a Series A funding round less than nine months after announcing a $4.5 million raise , TechCrunch was the first to report. The company is growing fast and says its valuation is up 50%. The startup released its first product in October 2022 using BaaS (banking-as-a-service) middleware. But the co-founders decided that it made more sense to own their own infrastructure and decided to build it out. By November 2023, Comun had launched a new program with Community Federal Savings Bank as a partner. Read more here . Stock-trading startup Public has acquired the brokerage accounts of Carta ’s secondaries business, TechCrunch confirmed. Carta, best known for its cap table management software, sits on a stockpile of data. It tried to expand into the bubbling hot secondary marketplace brokerage business, but in January, a startup customer publicly accused Carta of using the startup’s private cap table data to approach its shareholders in order to broker a sale without the startup’s knowledge. That allegation went viral and scared many of Carta’s customers, who threatened to leave. Days later, Carta announced that it was abandoning this business. In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Public said the customers of Carta Capital Markets who it acquired have a right to opt out.

Now, as it looks to revive its advertising business, its new incarnation X is hoping for a rerun. The company announced a new TV app available “on several app stores” as part of a wider effort to court more advertisers, creators and partners around a “video-first platform.” That pivot into video will also include a new video tab on X itself, it added. The tab has yet to launch. Users are noting that a beta of the TV app is already appearing on Amazon Fire TV and Google TV; we’ve been able to confirm we can see the Amazon Fire TV app ourselves. No sign of the app yet on Apple TV, Roku or other TV platforms. Twitter’s CEO Linda Yaccarino announced plans for the TV app initially in April of this year. The X TV app beta is now available on several app stores, with more platforms on the way 📺 Paired with our upcoming Video Tab, this marks a massive leap forward in transforming X into a video-first platform and unlocking new opportunities for creators, advertisers, and our… pic.twitter.com/1P72feD4Fd The new plan to drum up more advertising comes at a crunch time for X on the revenue front, with the company and its advertising business drowning underwater . With revenue plunging at the company over concerns of growing toxicity and falling user numbers, at least one major backer, Fidelity, marked down the valuation of its investment by as much as 71.5% at the end of 2023, implying a valuation of $12.5 billion for X, versus the $44 billion Elon Musk paid to buy it and take it private. Meanwhile, to fight back, X in August filed an antitrust suit against an advertising association, claiming its members were unfairly boycotting and not advertising on the platform . (The advertiser group was disbanded days after the suit, although it appears X is still suing .) Whether all of that can be offset by spinning up a new video business remains to be seen. From the screenshot, it seems like the TV app will surface videos from different organizations, publishers and creators on the app. There is also a chance that these creators have published these videos on their own apps or even YouTube, which has a much bigger audience of people consuming content on TV screens. This is not the first time that the social platform has dabbled in TV apps to drum up new activity. Back in 2016, when it was still Twitter, the company launched a slew of TV apps to “…watch live events and see what people are talking about, keeping them connected to what’s happening.” It shuttered most of these apps just two years later as it looked to cut some of its less profitable enterprises. It was not clear how many users the apps had at the time. Yet doing more in video continued to remain a potentially lucrative, if elusive, goal for the company. Just before Musk took over the platform, Twitter added a TikTok-like full-screen feed . You can still tap on a video to switch to the full-screen mode and scroll down to keep watching new clips. While a vertical feed or a TV app is not exactly a new move, X’s challenge will be to nudge creators to post original video content — and ultimately for those creators and that content to be compelling enough to drive more usage of its apps. Putting the cart before the horse has proven to be tough. X started an ad revenue share program last year , but it is based on engagement and views (as so many of these creator incentive programs are). When YouTube creator MrBeast posted a video and earned $263,000 from ad revenues, he called the payout “a bit of a facade” because advertisers bought ads on his videos, and the figure might be an outlier. MY FIRST X VIDEO MADE OVER $250,000! 😲 But it’s a bit of a facade. Advertisers saw the attention it was getting and bought ads on my video (I think) and thus my revenue per view is prob higher than what you’d experience pic.twitter.com/nViVpZbWBb In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that even after Musk met with creators, some of them were unclear about the platform’s long-term plan to support the creator economy . Musk has tried different experiences with videos, such as allowing video streaming on Spaces, enabling video calls to other users and even testing out a video conferencing tool . However, the company has yet to make any of these tools into sizable monetization opportunities."},
{"category": "Social", "title": "Bluesky continues to soar, adding 2M more new users in a matter of days", "date": "2024-09-03", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/03/bluesky-continues-to-soar-adding-2m-more-new-users-in-a-matter-of-days/", "content": "Social networking startup Bluesky continues to benefit from X’s shutdown in Brazil , having now added more than 2 million new users over the past four days, up from just half a million as of Friday. This rapid growth led some users to encounter the occasional error that would state there were “ Not Enough Resources ” to handle requests, as Bluesky engineers scrambled to keep the servers stable under the influx of new sign-ups. As new users downloaded the app, Bluesky jumped to becoming the No. 1 app in Brazil over the weekend, ahead of Meta’s X competitor, Instagram Threads . According to app intelligence firm Appfigures , Bluesky’s total downloads soared by 10,584% this weekend compared to last, and its downloads in Brazil were up by a whopping 1,018,952%. The growth seems to be having a halo effect, as downloads outside Brazil also rose by 584%, the firm noted. In part, this is due to Bluesky receiving downloads in 22 countries where it had barely seen any traction before. In terms of absolute downloads, countries that saw the most installs outside Brazil included the U.S., Portugal, the U.K., Canada and Spain. Those with the most download growth, however, were Portugal, Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Romania. Most of the latter group jumped from single-digit growth to growth in the thousands. Bluesky’s newcomers have actively engaged on the platform, too, driving up other key metrics. As one Bluesky engineer remarked , the number of likes on the social network grew to 104.6 million over the past four-day period, up from just 13 million when compared with a similar period just a week ago. Follows also grew from 1.4 million to 100.8 million while reposts grew from 1.3 million to 11 million. As of Monday, Bluesky said it had added 2.11 million users during the past four days, up from 26,000 users it had added in the week-ago period. In addition, the company noted it had seen “significantly more than a 100% [daily active users] increase.” On Tuesday, Bluesky told TechCrunch the number is now 2.4 million and continues to grow “by the minute.” The following day (after publication), Bluesky announced the figure had reached 2.6 million-plus, over 85% of which are Brazilian. Bluesky’s appeal to those forced to leave X may have to do with how closely the user experience resembles that of the now Elon Musk-owned app, formerly known as Twitter. Once incubated within Twitter, Bluesky spun out as a separate company and raised its own funding , but still retains much of Twitter’s look and feel. Like X, Bluesky offers features like likes, reposts, quote posts, lists, direct messages , search tools and user profiles, but it also improves on X’s capabilities in other ways. As a decentralized social network, users can set up their own instances (servers that run Bluesky and connect to others over the AT Protocol), customize their feeds , subscribe to third-party moderation services and create and share “starter packs” that link to curated sets of recommended users to follow. In a coming update, Bluesky also plans to add support for video, the company says. Another factor to consider here is how Bluesky’s approach to content and moderation differs from Threads. Even when it was Twitter, X has long been known as a hotbed for breaking news and political debates. Threads has taken the opposite approach, saying it would not default to recommending political content on its platform. Instead, Threads wants to make itself palatable to brands and influencers, similar to Instagram, as it intends to eventually monetize via ads . Given that X’s ban in Brazil is tied to politics — the country wanted control over what could be said on the platform — it’s likely that some Brazilians opting for Bluesky wanted to join a network that was not centralized and as easily controlled. On platforms like X, moderation decisions are left up to the site’s owners, but on decentralized networks, the users are in charge. That flexibility, combined with Bluesky’s ease of use, could make the network a bigger draw than others. For instance, though Mastodon offers its own decentralized network, the recent user growth driven by Brazil was on a much smaller scale. On Saturday, Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochko said the service had seen 4,200 signups from Brazil, up from 152 signups on August 28, for instance. That could speak to the fact that Brazilians want more than decentralization: They also want a place that more closely resembles Twitter/X. Meta has not yet commented on how large an increase it’s seen on Threads driven by Brazilians leaving X, but as a network that already has over 200 million monthly active users, even the addition of thousands or millions would not be as noticeable a gain, compared with the much smaller Bluesky. Still, it’s also possible that Brazilians wanted to move to a place that was separate from friends, family and creators — one that defaulted to public postings and felt more like Twitter once did. Bluesky’s culture, which tends toward s***posting and memes, has the sort of chaotic energy of an early Twitter. X is said to have had north of 20 million users in Brazil, which means there’s plenty of growth to be captured all around.

Available for smartphones, tablets and Wear OS watches, the new features include audio descriptions of images, text-to-speech technology for web pages in Chrome, and the ability to look up songs with “Circle to Search,” among other things. Initially announced in May, all Android users are officially getting “TalkBack,” an accessibility feature for people who are blind or have low vision. The feature is Google’s version of a screen reader, which provides detailed audio descriptions of digital images. TalkBack is powered by Gemini Nano, Google’s large-language-model-based platform. Users can now hear descriptions of all sorts of images, like online products, photos in their camera roll or pictures in text messages. Another new accessibility feature is “ Listen to this page ,” which allows users to listen to web pages in the Chrome browser, whether that’s a blog post, news article or recipe. The feature is helpful for those who are blind or have a learning disability, and people who prefer listening over reading. Users can pause, rewind and fast forward, as well as set their preferred listening speed and the type of language and voice. It supports several languages, including English, French, German, Arabic, Hindi and Spanish. Google’s Circle to Search feature, which was announced earlier this year, enables users to search from anywhere on their phone by making gestures like circling, highlighting, scribbling or tapping. The feature now allows Android users to search for songs via a new music button, eliminating the need to open a third-party app like Shazam. Users can simply activate Circle to Search by long-pressing the home button or navigation bar. The new music capability can identify songs playing from the phone or in the background through nearby speakers. In addition to displaying the track name and artist, it also directs them to music videos via the YouTube app. According to some Reddit users , the music capability has been gradually rolling out to Samsung device users for a few weeks now. Android’s earthquake alert system has been available for some time. However, it’s now expanding to all U.S. states and its six territories. It was first launched in California in 2020, and it uses smartphone sensors to detect tremors and help people prepare for natural disasters and emergencies. For earthquakes of a magnitude of 4.5 or higher, Android sends out two types of warning alerts, either giving you a heads-up about a light amount of shaking or an alert recommending more immediate action if it detects extreme shaking. Android smartwatch users can use offline maps, a Google Maps capability for people to get around if they leave their phone behind, get lost or find themselves without cell phone service. Watch OS also launched two new shortcuts to allow users to search for destinations using their voice or quickly tapping the watch face to see where they are on the map. These features are launching alongside Android 15, which will roll out to more devices later this year, including Pixel devices."},

The company also revealed that Android 15 will launch on select devices from Samsung, Honor, iQOO, Lenovo, Motorola, Nothing, OnePlus, Oppo, realme, Sharp, Sony, Tecno, vivo and Xiaomi in the coming months. The Android update will bring new additions like Private Space , a feature that lets users silo a portion of the operating system for sensitive information. The software update will also allow users to save their favorite split-screen app combinations for quick access and pin the taskbar permanently on the screen. Other additions include partial screen recording and more convenient passkeys. As part of Tuesday’s announcement, Google revealed that it’s making Android 15 available on the Android Open Source Project, which provides the information and source code needed to create custom versions of the Android OS, as well as port devices and accessories to the Android platform and ensure compatibility requirements. Google says Android 15 gives developers more ways to further tune their app experience to improve the way their apps run on any platform release. It’s also making improvements in areas like typography, internationalization, media and camera experiences, the user experience, privacy and security, Google says. On the latter, Android 15 will support sign-in with passkeys with a single tap and other new protections against malicious actors. As part of its developer outreach, Google will launch an educational series called Spotlight Weeks , where the company will delve into technical topics around building for Android, starting with a week of content about Android 15. “Android 15 continues our mission of building a private and secure platform that helps improve your productivity while giving you new capabilities to produce beautiful apps, superior media and camera experiences, and an intuitive user experience, particularly on tablets and foldables,” wrote Matthew McCullough, VP of Product for Android Developer, in a blog post. Android 15 gives developers access to improved typography and internalization, along with camera and media improvements. Google is also making most app-facing changes opt-in to give developers more time to make necessary app changes before their app targets SDK version 35."},

Today, a splashy startup that has taken that concept to heart — literally and figuratively — is expanding. Neko Health was co-founded by Spotify’s Daniel Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne with a mission to improve preventative healthcare with annual full-body scans and AI-powered insights that can detect conditions like heart disease and skin cancer. Now the Swedish company is launching in London, its first city outside of its home market. For £299 and an hour of your time, the company runs a series of scans and tests that it says creates “millions” of datapoints that help determine your state of health across a range of cardiovascular, metabolic, and other conditions. An in-person meeting with a doctor to discuss the data is included in the session. Those interested in getting in line for a visit can sign up here . The company is coming to the U.K. on the heels of a strong start in Stockholm, where it has opened two clinics in its first year of operation. To date , it has scanned 2,707 people, and while 78.5% of them were found to have no health issues, results for some 14.1% of visitors raised issues that required further medical treatment. Some 1%, it said, were identified to have “severe” cardiovascular, metabolic, or cancerous conditions. Of that group, none were aware of their conditions prior to visiting Neko, the company said. Neko is Japanese for “cat” and Nilsonne tells me that it’s a reference to cats having nine lives, or more specifically a lot of lucky breaks. “That’s how we would hope that our system feels for our users,” he said. Despite the participation of a major tech figure like Ek, the company’s ethos is actually very understated. As a result, it sometimes gets in its own way. When I visited the London clinic to go through the testing process to write this article, it took me a few trips up and down a London street to realize that I had walked straight past the Neko clinic, which was marked only by its logo — an N sliced and shifted through its waistline — at the top of a glass doorway. The rest of the operation is below ground level, making the street-level lobby look more like a discreet entry to a fancy apartment block rather than a health center. Once you enter the building and descend the stairs, you enter an equally sparse lobby with pared-down furniture, muted colors and lighting, and low-volume, soothing electronic music piped throughout. The concept is somewhere between elegant day spa and futuristic medical clinic. Once there, you’re funneled through their system. An assistant takes a few notes about you before leading you into a room where you strip down to your underpants, a robe, and slippers. A second assistant then measures your height and weight before moving you to a cylindrical chamber that feels like a cross between a tanning booth and a security scanner at an airport. The chamber itself is fitted with 70 sensors, including dozens of volumetric and other cameras, to produce a composite picture of you with 50 million data points. From there, you move to an examination bed, where you have another two scans, measurements of your eye pressure and blood pressure, and a grip test. Finally, the the clinician draws a blood sample. The blood sample is the only invasive test that Neko carries out, and altogether the experience takes under an hour. Soon after, you change and are taken to a separate consultation room where a doctor goes through your data. Neko’s focus is on risks and proactive prevention rather than existing conditions. Data points are grouped and presented along the lines of different potential problems you might encounter related to them — among them skin cancer (my moles were counted and it seems that I have many more than the average person), high blood pressure, and metabolic syndrome (a group of conditions that can lead to illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes). If the data reveals problems, you’re referred for more diagnostics and channeled to doctors for further examinations. Nilsonne tells me that Ek first approached him to chat about healthcare over a Twitter direct message. The year was 2018, and Nilsonne’s company at the time — an AI-powered, smart home energy monitoring startup — was running out of money and winding down after failing to find product-market fit with the big energy companies it expected to be its customers. “Then out of nowhere, I get a direct message on Twitter from Daniel.” Ek had just taken audio streaming platform Spotify through an IPO and was a newly minted billionaire looking for another thorny problem to solve, something that would have “a positive contribution to the world,” in Nilsonne’s words. He’d gotten it into his head that he wanted to reinvent healthcare, just as he’d reinvented recorded music consumption with Spotify. “So he reached out to me. We didn’t know each other, but he was aware of what I had been doing, working with hardware and software and AI.” Ek offered to fund a startup with Nilsonne at the head on the spot, but Nilsonne at first rejected him. Neither of them have a medical background. But Nilsonne does come from a family of doctors, so it’s in his consciousness, and Ek was obsessed, so the two kept talking, and they could see something starting to take shape. Wearables like Fitbits and Apple Watches, Nilsonne said, have led to an “incredible explosion of abundance of high-quality health information.” Combining that with AI and the ability to draw “sensible conclusions” from all this data, “it was very clear that we could create a different healthcare system.” Thus began five years of building prototypes for the physical clinics and their component hardware, as well as the software to analyze the data. Neko itself, plus its co-founders Nilsonne and Ek, come from an unlikely location. Sweden is home to one of the world’s most famous socialized medicine programs. You might assume that the existence of free, and good, healthcare would make a paid service like Neko a hard sell to consumers. But so far at least, the opposite has been true. When the company last year announced a $60 million funding round, it had a waiting list of “thousands” lined up to get scans. Now that list is up to 22,000. Yes, some of that might be down to Neko being the latest project from one of Sweden’s most famous living entrepreneurs (who is also one of Neko’s major investors by way of his investment vehicle, Prima Materia). But Nilsonne believes Neko is addressing an important gap that will give the startup staying power. The majority of healthcare services, including those in Sweden and the U.K., are focused on treating conditions rather than preventative care. But because our populations are aging , the number of conditions that need treatment are rapidly increasing, and that’s putting the whole system under pressure “in an unsustainable way,” Nilsonne said, explaining that 75% of healthcare costs go toward chronic diseases. “Our hypothesis is that prevention and early detection could be the things that would solve a lot of these problems. Most chronic conditions are fully preventable, or you can delay them by decades if you have effective early interventions. But of course, in our system, you basically show up when you already have the disease, and then it’s too late to reverse them, and there are a lot of costs associated with it.” (It is far from being the only startup focusing on preventative healthcare technology. Zoi in France and Germany’s Aware are two in Europe. In the U.K., the NHS does offer a Health Check that covers many of the same areas that Neko does, although as Nilsonne points out, it’s less frequent.) “The NHS health check is available only once every five years to individuals aged 44 to 74,” Nilsonne points out. “It offers a much narrower range of tests and does not include a consultation with a doctor to discuss the results. We know from our data that chronic diseases are increasingly appearing in individuals under 44,” which also happens to be the average age of a Neko customer. “Therefore, it’s crucial to adopt a proactive approach to health to identify potential issues early, take corrective action, and monitor progress over time.”"},

And it’s blaming the move in part on generative AI. In the U.S., some Canva Teams subscribers on older pricing plans are seeing the sticker price for a five-person plan jump from $119.99 per year to $500 per year (with a 40% discount for the first 12 months). In Australia , meanwhile, the flat $39.99 AUS (about $26) per-month fee for up to five users has been raised to $13.50 AUS for each user. On an individual user basis, Canva Teams prices are now $100 per person, or $10 a month per person, with a minimum of three people required for a Teams plan. Those prices were quietly changed earlier this year for new customers, but now the company is changing the price for customers who’d previously paid a lower price. The price changes don’t apply to Canva’s Pro or Enterprise tiers. In a statement to TechCrunch, a Canva spokesperson confirmed the new price points and pointed to the company’s growing suite of generative AI tools — including Magic Studio — as a reason for the adjustments. They also noted that some of Canva’s customers had been locked into lower prices that Canva no longer offers; Canva quietly changed its Teams pricing earlier this year to $10 per month for each user. “Our original pricing reflected the early stage of this product and has remained unchanged for the last four years,” the spokesperson said. “We’re now updating the price for customers on this older plan to reflect our expanded product experience.” Canva price increase is one of the biggest increases I have ever seen YoY. pic.twitter.com/8MOEYMcRm3 Canva’s price hikes, which come as the company readies for an IPO , haven’t been well received, unsurprisingly. Users took particular issue with the fact that Canva communicated the changes through customer emails instead of publicly, as it has in the past. The new pricing is a departure from Canva’s roots as an affordable alternative to design software like Adobe’s. It may also be a reflection of the startup growing too quickly, too fast; in March, Canva acquired U.K.-based graphic design software firm Serif for ~$380 million and just in August bought generative AI image company Leonardo . Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the Canva Teams price for Australian customers. It is $13.50 per user per month, with a three-user minimum."},

Christian Sobkowski, meanwhile, recalls his days working in financial services, most notably at PayPal, where he helped expand the company’s business across Europe. It’s no wonder, then, that the two decided to come together as co-CEOs, pairing their financial backgrounds to create a company that, in hindsight, would have made Pannu’s former day job much easier. “With Treasury teams deciding how the largest corporations move cash around the world, it became obvious that guiding those money flows was worthy of bringing the best talent to rethink how it’s done,” Sobkowski told TechCrunch. The result is Palm, launched in 2023 with the goal of making cash management for enterprise treasury teams easier. Today, it’s announcing a $6.1 million seed round led by Speedinvest and Target Global. The company has built an all-in-one platform to let businesses move money between hundreds of bank accounts and subsidiaries in a more efficient way. Palm’s platform tracks daily money movement, and the setup process takes weeks rather than months like traditional treasurer systems, the founders claim. It also has an automated feature that provides tailored cash forecasting in a way that the company says outperforms human models at least 75% of the time. “Although we had a treasury management system, all of the forecasting and money movements were managed in spreadsheets because the systems we used weren’t reliable enough to build the process around,” Pannu recalled of his time at Uber. “They required tons of workarounds and costly customization to meet our requirements. With an ever-evolving business, we couldn’t invest the time [or] money to customizing a process within the tool that would later become redundant.” For many companies, Pannu says the execution of payments is quite straightforward — but the friction and decision-making leading up to making such decisions is “arduous.” “Treasury teams must retrieve balances across hundreds of accounts, understand the funding need on these accounts, determine when the payment is required to ensure it gets there on time and determine the correct commercial instrument is being designated for the movement,” Pannu mapped out. “Teams must also have the funds follow an intricate map across entity structures to ensure compliance.” In other words — it’s a lot of work that perhaps could use some automation. Palm has clients listed on the NASDAQ and NYSE but declined to share their names. The company plans to use the fundraise to expand its team, especially within product and engineering. Palm’s closed beta is also now accepting new customers. The company’s beta ends at the end of this year. This story was updated to reflect the proper spelling of Speedinvest."},

The British American global asset firm disclosed the information in a securities filing. Based on the adjusted valuation of its PharmEasy shares, the Indian startup’s implied valuation at the end of June was about $458 million. The development may come as a surprise: PharmEasy in 2023 launched a rights issue to raise $300 million, which it then adjusted to $417 million. The rights issue, which allows existing investors to buy new shares in the firm at a much lower valuation, was oversubscribed, PharmEasy co-founder Dharmil Sheth said in a LinkedIn post. A regulatory filing in April 2024 indicated that the startup had secured about $216 million . Even before the rights issue, investors had started to cut the worth of their holdings in PhamEasy. Janus Henderson’s newest valuation estimation suggests that PharmEasy is now worth less than the $600 million+ it paid to acquire diagnostic lab chain Thyrocare in 2021. PharmEasy — backed by Temasek, TPG, B Capital and Prosus — didn’t respond to a request for comment. Janus declined to comment. PharmEasy, which has raised about $1 billion to date, offers a range of services alongside medicine delivery, including tools and information on wellness, consultations, diagnostic and radiology tests, and treatment deliveries. The once-flying startup had filed for an $843 million IPO in November 2021 but later deferred the plan. Instead, it sought to fund some of its fast growth through debt. A $300 million loan it borrowed from Goldman Sachs ultimately proved costly to the firm as it struggled to repay the capital and raise new funds with equity after the market had turned. “A lot has been written and a lot said about us. We generally don’t respond and believe in just doing what is right for the team, the shareholders and the company and just out-execute. It’s easier to write about companies as they are ‘entities at the end.’ We tend to forget that at the end these entities are made by real people with real sweat, blood, tears and a lot more! Cheers to what the team did in the last one year > achieved the seemingly impossible,” PharmEasy’s Sheth wrote in the earlier LinkedIn post. Many investors are marking down the worth of their startup holdings globally; 360 One, an investor in Indian news aggregator startup Dailyhunt, wrote in a note to its LPs recently that it values the Indian firm at $2.9 billion , down from about $5 billion earlier, TechCrunch reported last week."},

You have probably used Google Search for as long as you can remember; it’s what replaced things like phone books and encyclopedias. But just because Google runs the most popular engine doesn’t mean you have to use it. If you have never considered a search engine beyond Google, you might be surprised to see what else is out there. There are many Google Search alternatives on the market that have gained traction. Whether you’re looking for increased privacy, enhanced AI features or just something different, there are some notable options worth checking out. While Microsoft’s Bing and Yahoo are arguably the most well-known, there are tons of Google Search alternatives that have also been around for a while. But for this list, we’re focusing on newer, lesser-known entrants into the search engine space. (Disclaimer: TechCrunch is owned by Yahoo.) Now, let’s get into some Google Search alternatives worth exploring. If you want more privacy when you search, DuckDuckGo may be the right search engine for you. DuckDuckGo doesn’t track your search history, and its privacy policy outlines that it doesn’t collect or share any of your personal information, unlike Google, which collects your data to personalize your search results and the ads it shows you. DuckDuckGo has a simple layout that allows you to search for images, videos, news, maps and shopping results. You can also filter your results based on time, so you can choose to see results from the past day, week, month or year. Plus, you can base your results on specific regions. Like Google, DuckDuckGo offers a safe search feature. You can choose to have it off or on a “strict” or “moderate” setting. If you’re interested in AI, DuckDuckGo gives you anonymous access to a few different AI models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini, Anthropic’s Claude 3, Meta’s Llama 3.1 and Mixtral. DuckDuckGo reassures users that their conversations won’t be used to train AI. Ecosia is a good Google Search alternative for people who want to help save the planet. The search engine contributes to planting trees and has planted more than 213 million trees to date in over 35 countries. All of the search engine’s profits go toward its tree-planting and other environmental projects. The search engine is simple to use, and its results are powered by Google and Microsoft’s Bing, so you still get the same sorts of results but also help the environment while doing so. Ecosia uses essential cookies to provide search results, but searches are encrypted. If you do want personalized search results, you can opt into them. Ecosia will ask for your consent before enabling personalized search results and ads. Like DuckDuckGo, Brave Search also uses privacy as one of its selling points. The service says it doesn’t share, sell or collect your personal data. Brave Search doesn’t rely on other search engines and is instead built on its own independent search index. Brave surfaces AI-powered answers to most questions at the top of your search results. If you don’t want AI-powered answers and only want to see standard results, you can toggle the feature off in the search engine’s settings. The search engine also has a “Discussions” section that will display content from forums like Reddit. Plus, you can refine your search results with the engine’s “Goggles” feature, which lets you filter your results with options like “no Pinterest,” “tech blogs,” “news from the left,” “news from the right” and more. Like some other engines on this list, Brave offers a safe search feature that you can have “off” or on a “strict” or “moderate” setting. If you are used to Google search results and don’t want to try something else but want added privacy, Startpage might be a good choice. While Startpage is powered by Google, it promises that users don’t have to worry about personal data collection, tracking or targeting. The search engine’s “Anonymous View” feature masks your identity while you browse other websites, similar to a VPN. Startpage blocks trackers and also removes your IP address from all of its global premise servers. Startpage also lets you access unprofiled news, which means it doesn’t show news based on your browsing behavior. The search engine does show you promotional content on its homepage and search results page, but you can turn this off in Startpage’s settings. The search engine operates pretty similarly to Google, but if you want to access Maps, it will send you to Google or Bing. Perplexity is embroiled in a series of controversies at the moment. However, it is one of the most popular AI search engines on the market, so it’s worth mentioning. Unlike the other search engines on this list that simply offer AI features on top of their search results, Perplexity was created as an AI-powered search engine. Think of it like combining an AI chatbot with a search engine. Perplexity uses a conversational approach to search and gives you a concise answer to a question. If you don’t want a straightforward answer, Perplexity provides you with a list of websites in addition to its concise answer if you want to explore the web. Plus, there is a “related” section at the end of your search that brings up related queries that encourage further exploration. While the search engine is free to use, you can sign up for a $20 monthly subscription for additional features, such as access to image-generation models and the option to select your preferred AI model. Although OpenAI’s SearchGPT isn’t widely available, it’s definitely one to look forward to once it officially launches. Given the success of OpenAI’s other products , the release of SearchGPT is sure to cause a ripple in Google’s Search dominance. OpenAI has said SearchGPT will give users “fast and timely answers” to questions. You will be able to type in a query and receive information and photos from the web along with links to relevant sources. You can then ask follow-up questions or explore related searches in a sidebar. Responses from the service cite and link sources so you know where the information is coming from. OpenAI has noted that since SearchGPT is about search and is separate from training OpenAI’s generative AI foundation models, the service will surface results from sites even if they have opted out of generative AI training. SearchGPT is still a prototype, so we can’t say too much about it now, but it will definitely be one to check out once it’s widely available."},
{"category": "Enterprise", "title": "CrowdStrike faces onslaught of legal action from faulty software update", "date": "2024-09-02", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/02/crowdstrike-faces-onslaught-of-legal-action-from-faulty-software-update/", "content": "When the now infamous CrowdStrike software update took down companies all over the world in July, it was inevitable that lawsuits would follow — and follow they have. Delta threatening to sue the company for as much as $500 million in damages and hiring lawyer David Boies is perhaps the highest-profile example. Among Boies’ wide range of high-profile clients are Theranos, Harvey Weinstein, victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and Al Gore in Bush v. Gore around the results of the 2000 presidential election. He also led the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s. Even before Delta came forward, shareholders were looking for their pound of flesh, filing a class action lawsuit against CrowdStrike alleging that the company had misled them regarding its software update procedures. For its part, CrowdStrike hired the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to defend the company against the expected onslaught of legal action, giving credence to the idea that lawyers were going to make big bucks off of this mistake. To a lesser extent, Microsoft has also been drawn into the battle because the faulty CrowdStrike software update only affected Windows machines. But for the most part, it’s CrowdStrike’s cross to bear, and it is facing a daunting legal challenge, says Rob Wilkins, who works at Florida law firm Jones Foster, where he co-chairs the complex litigation and dispute resolution practice group. What could save CrowdStrike, however, is contractual limits on damages, which are typically built into enterprise software contracts. “What I found was interesting is that there’s a contractual limit on damages between CrowdStrike and Delta, and I assume that there’s going to be a similar type of contractual limit on damages in the other customers’ contracts,” Wilkins told TechCrunch. Delta is alleging, however, that the bad software update amounted to gross negligence or willful misconduct on CrowdStrike’s part, which could potentially void the contractual cap. Delta service was disrupted for five days , compared with United, which faced only three days of CloudStrike-related delays. CrowdStrike says that Delta has had issues with its own internal systems and that the company can’t attribute the entire outage to the faulty update from CrowdStrike. Wilkins says Delta could have problems proving gross negligence or willful misconduct, which carries a significant burden of proof. Shareholders alleging the company misled and defrauded them by not warning them about their lack of a software testing regimen also face significant challenges proving that in court. “It comes down to: Was CrowdStrike intentionally misrepresenting or failing to tell the investors that it was completely up to date with respect to all of its security procedures and control procedures with respect to its software platform?” Wilkins said. Wilkins says that whatever happens, the individual companies suing CrowdStrike will likely come together to file a class action suit against the company because individual suits will get costly and unwieldy for everyone involved. It’s worth noting, he says, that once there is a class action, that tends to attract more companies that want to be included. “Typically with class actions, people pile on, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the case, and then you see everything being consolidated into a by the multidistrict litigation panel, assigning all the cases across the country to one particular federal district court for all discovery-related purposes — and that cuts down significantly on the process,” he said. Once that is in place, there tends to be a “bellwether” trial, where one case is floated as a test case for all the other plaintiffs in the class action, and however the jury decides, that’s a road map for other settlements moving forward. “Then you can go back to CrowdStrike and say, ‘Look, you got hit for $20 million by this one company, and we’ve got 15 other companies that are suing you in these class actions with the same facts, etc., you should settle,’” he said. One other complicating factor is the role of insurance companies, which would be covering CrowdStrike and its customers against possible damages in these cases. The customers’ insurance companies might be coming after CrowdStrike as well to get back some portion of the payments they made. “There’s probably insurance there, and they’re probably going to have the carrier come in, and usually they defend these things. While I haven’t seen their specific policy, in cybersecurity policies that I reviewed, it would cover this type of negligence. And so it depends on what they have, and what exclusions they have in their policy, but I do see insurance being a part of it.” In addition to the monetary issues, Wilkins says there is a reputational component, and the sooner this all goes away, the sooner CrowdStrike can move forward. The company has hired good attorneys to defend itself, but at the end of the day, the company will have to make peace with shareholders and customers, relationships that are key to the success of any business. “It seems to me that their approach to this is going to be to fight, but also to fight with the understanding that they really need to resolve it and move on, so that’s what I would expect.”"},

The CEO says the simplified version aims to improve the platform’s accessibility and usability. For those who remember Snapchat’s 2018 redesign , this news may do little to stoke confidence. Spiegel attempted to rally employee spirits with his letter on Tuesday after a depressing year for the company’s stock price, which has fallen nearly 50% in 2024. “Investors are concerned that we aren’t growing faster,” said Spiegel in the letter. The “simplified” Snapchat may be an attempt to capture older users, who are historically perplexed by the app’s not-so-intuitive design. Snapchat does a lot better at attracting younger audiences, who seem to just get the app. But this isn’t the first time Snapchat has tried to reconcile these issues. You might remember Snap’s 2017 earnings call when Spiegel admitted he had heard that “Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use,” particularly for older folks. Months later, Snap pushed out a major redesign to reclaim those users, jamming Stories between private messages, among other changes that ended up infuriating more users than it attracted. A 2018 Change.org petition to “remove the new Snapchat update” received 1.2 million signatories , while celebrity influencers like Kylie Jenner, Chrissy Teigen, and Marques Brownlee expressed their frustration. But even worse, the redesign cratered the platform’s ad views and revenue, alienating its younger user base while failing in its bid to attract older users. By May of 2018, Snap was scrambling to roll back some of the changes. Spiegel writes in Tuesday’s letter that early tests of the simplified redesign have been “directionally positive,” though the CEO notes “We will be thoughtful and deliberate about making a change of this magnitude.” He’s almost definitely alluding to the 2018 redesign failure, which I’m sure no one at Snap has forgotten about. The announcement of a new, simplified version of Snapchat was tucked into Spiegel’s broader musings about Snap’s business strategy. He claimed that Snap’s venture into augmented reality glasses — which it calls Spectacles — would yield a market with no competitors. Perhaps he’s pretending that Meta’s AR glasses, Meta Ray-Bans, simply don’t exist? To stimulate Snapchat’s struggling ad division, Spiegel also announced new placements for ads, called Sponsored Snaps and Promoted Places. The former allows advertisers to send Snapchats directly to users’ chat inboxes, and the latter lets advertisers promote destinations on Snap Map."},

When he was head of product at Zynga, he experienced the height of mobile games, working on hits like Words with Friends; then as a vice president at Blizzard Entertainment, he helped produce tentpole hits like Diablo Immortal. And then, as a director of product management at Meta, he learned to see games in new dimensions while working on the VR game, Horizon Worlds. “I had to forget what I thought were universal truths and learn a whole new set of ways to do things,” Lu told TechCrunch. Now Lu wants a front-row seat to where video games are heading. After joining the firm as an investor in 2022, Lu helped launch the firm’s Speedrun accelerator, which invests $750,000 apiece into about 40 gaming startups twice a year. Now on the firm’s third cohort — with the applications for the fourth cohort now open — Lu said he’s seen how AI and new distribution platforms are changing the industry. Half of the accelerator’s current batch are AI companies, doing everything from creating AI-crafted stories to using AI for 3D avatars. “The last game that I worked on at Blizzard took six years and a $250 million budget to ship,” he said, referring to Diablo Immortal. “But wouldn’t it be so great if that kind of quality of game could be done with a 10th of the budget and a 10th of the people?” We might quibble with how great it is for AI to kill high-paying developer jobs at the largest game companies. But if AI also helps more startups form and be qualitatively competitive, that’s a compelling thought. Lu says he’s seen firsthand how companies are getting creative, citing Clementine , a startup that went through Speedrun. The company “released a demo where you had to solve a mystery by talking to AI and making sure that they didn’t find out that you were a human,” he said. That may be a terrifying premise, or a tongue-in-cheek one, depending on how existential a threat you think AI could become. Lu also mentioned Echo Chunk, a company that raised $1.4 million in a round led by Speedrun. Echo Chunk went viral for its game Echo Chess that uses AI to instantly generate an endless number of levels. “These are all fairly early explorations,” he said. “But we’re excited in general about novel types of game design interactions and game dynamics that can be unlocked because of AI.” Lu is also advocating for startups to build games atop Discord. Earlier this year, Discord made it so developers can create apps for people to use within the chatting platform. Lu said that, over the course of his career, he’s seen the places for people to discover games dwindle; for example, no one finds games through social media feeds anymore, like many did with FarmVille. “Where can we find the next platform where truly social games can be created and distributed?” Lu said. Several companies entered the accelerator building within Discord. Lu said several more pivoted to building in Discord over the course of the 12 weeks. “There are more games being made than ever, and it’s hard for developers to stand out,” he said. He hopes building on Discord will help “people to find pieces of content that they would really like playing.”"},

He must weigh the most extreme theoretical risks of AI systems — including their potential role in human deaths — against potentially thwarting California’s AI boom. He has until September 30 to sign SB 1047 into law, or veto it altogether. Introduced by state senator Scott Wiener, SB 1047 aims to prevent the possibility of very large AI models creating catastrophic events , such as loss of life or cyberattacks costing more than $500 million in damages. To be clear, very few AI models exist today that are large enough to be covered by the bill, and AI has never been used for a cyberattack of this scale. But the bill concerns the future of AI models, not problems that exist today. SB 1047 would make AI model developers liable for their harms — like making gun manufacturers liable for mass shootings — and would grant California’s attorney general the power to sue AI companies for hefty penalties if their technology was used in a catastrophic event. In the event that a company is acting recklessly, a court can order them to stop operations; covered models must also have a “kill switch” that lets them be shut down if they are deemed dangerous. The bill could reshape America’s AI industry, and it is a signature away from becoming law. Here is how the future of SB 1047 might play out. Wiener argues that Silicon Valley needs more liability, previously telling TechCrunch that America must learn from its past failures in regulating technology. Newsom could be motivated to act decisively on AI regulation and hold Big Tech to account. A few AI executives have emerged as cautiously optimistic about SB 1047, including Elon Musk . Another cautious optimist on SB 1047 is Microsoft’s former chief AI officer Sophia Velastegui. She told TechCrunch that “SB 1047 is a good compromise,” while admitting the bill is not perfect. “I think we need an office of responsible AI for America, or any country that works on it. It shouldn’t be just Microsoft,” said Velastegui. Anthropic is another cautious proponent of SB 1047, though the company hasn’t taken an official position on the bill. Several of the startup’s suggested changes were added to SB 1047 , and CEO Dario Amodei now says the bill’s “benefits likely outweigh its costs” in a letter to California’s governor . Thanks to Anthropic’s amendments, AI companies can only be sued after their AI models cause some catastrophic harm, not before, as a previous version of SB 1047 stated. Given the loud industry opposition to the bill, it would not be surprising if Newsom vetoed it. He would be hanging his reputation on SB 1047 if he signs it, but if he vetoes, he could kick the can down the road another year or let Congress handle it. “This [SB 1047] changes the precedent for which we’ve dealt with software policy for 30 years,” argued Andreessen Horowitz general partner Martin Casado in an interview with TechCrunch. “It shifts liability away from applications, and applies it to infrastructure, which we’ve never done.” The tech industry has responded with a resounding outcry against SB 1047. Alongside a16z, Speaker Nancy Pelosi , OpenAI , Big Tech trade groups, and notable AI researchers are also urging Newsom to not sign the bill. They worry that this paradigm shift on liability will have a chilling effect on California’s AI innovation. A chilling effect on the startup economy is the last thing anyone wants. The AI boom has been a huge stimulant for the American economy, and Newsom is facing pressure not to squander that. Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has asked Newsom to veto the bill , saying “AI is foundational to America’s economic growth,” in a letter to him. If Newsom signs the bill, nothing happens on day one, a source involved with drafting SB 1047 tells TechCrunch. By January 1, 2025, tech companies would need to write safety reports for their AI models. At this point, California’s attorney general could request an injunctive order, requiring an AI company to stop training or operating their AI models if a court finds them to be dangerous. In 2026, more of the bill kicks into gear. At that point, the Board of Frontier Models would be created and start collecting safety reports from tech companies. The nine-person board, selected by California’s governor and legislature, would make recommendations to California’s attorney general about which companies do and do not comply. That same year, SB 1047 would also require that AI model developers hire auditors to assess their safety practices, effectively creating a new industry for AI safety compliance. And California’s attorney general would be able to start suing AI model developers if their tools are used in catastrophic events. By 2027, the Board of Frontier Models could start issuing guidance to AI model developers on how to safely and securely train and operate AI models. If Newsom vetoes SB 1047, OpenAI’s desires would come true, and federal regulators would likely take the lead on regulating AI models …eventually. On Thursday, OpenAI and Anthropic laid the groundwork for what federal AI regulation would look like. They agreed to give the AI Safety Institute, a federal body, early access to their advanced AI models, according to a press release . At the same time, OpenAI has endorsed a bill that would let the AI Safety Institute set standards for AI models. “For many reasons, we think it’s important that this happens at the national level,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a tweet on Thursday. Reading between the lines, federal agencies typically produce less onerous tech regulation than California does and take considerably longer to do so. But more than that, Silicon Valley has historically been an important tactical and business partner for the United States government. “There actually is a long history of state-of-the-art computer systems working with the feds,” said Casado. “When I worked for the national labs, every time a new supercomputer would come out, the very first version would go to the government. We would do it so the government had capabilities, and I think that’s a better reason than for safety testing.”"},

The VC firm announced Tuesday that it has closed a new $50 million fund, AIM AI Fund, which will back AI startups out of its own AIM-X accelerator in Saudi Arabia as well as other AI startups across the globe. SparkLabs’ new fund and its wider investment aims underscore the bigger trends that have swirled around artificial intelligence for the last few years. The explosion of interest in generative AI in particular has led to a surge of startups in the space, as well as a rush of investors looking for the next Open AI — or at the very least, a startup that a bigger company might snap up as it looks to sharpen its own AI edge. It also points to how the AI opportunity continues to widen beyond Silicon Valley. AIM-X is an AI-focused startup accelerator that SparkLabs launched earlier this year in the kingdom as part of its AI Mission, a national initiative to bolster AI technology over the next five years. There has been a significant increase in AI startups on a global scale over the past few years. As of March 2024, more than 210 AI unicorns, valued at over $1 billion, have emerged, per the Edge Delta report . Yet despite it being a global phenomenon, the U.S. overall still leads the pack for founding the most AI startups between 2013 and 2022 with 4,633 startups, according to the report. About 35% of SparkLabs’ new fund will support accelerator participants, with the remaining 65% targeted at making Series A and Series B investments beyond Saudi Arabia, according to co-founder and partner of SparkLabs Bernard Moon. “The accelerator will seek a minority allocation for Saudi Arabia or MENA investments, about 10%-20%,” Moon said. “The majority will be just the best AI startups regardless of location… I assume the majority in the U.S.” The average check size for accelerator participants will be $200,000, but it can go up to $500,000 in unique situations, Moon told TechCrunch. The Series A and Series B investments will be between $1 million and $5 million, Moon added. It aims to invest between 50 and 70 companies in total from the fund. SparkLabs did not name its limited partners, but Moon said its LPs include a government fund of funds. Its first batch will be announced live at the GAIN Summit (Global AI Summit) in Riyadh next Tuesday, September 10. Moon exclusively told TechCrunch that SparkLabs has already invested in 14 startups, the first batch, via the AI fund: SparkLabs has more than 14 funds across the globe and two funds in Saudi Arabia. It has invested in more than 550 startups globally."},

However, in recent months, the Indian government has begun investing in an effort to establish the country in semiconductors, as companies worldwide have adopted a “China-plus-one” strategy, seeking alternatives to China. BigEndian Semiconductors aims to capitalize on this shift by kicking off development of surveillance chips for cameras. Founded in May, the Bengaluru-based fabless design startup is led by CEO Sunil Kumar, a former executive at ARM Broadcom, and Intel, and the rest of the founding team add experience at chipmakers like Broadcom and Cypress Semiconductors. Kumar told TechCrunch BigEndian’s founding members had known each other for 25 years. However, he said that they decided to establish the startup after seeing significant domestic consumption — about 50 million cameras’ worth, close to $4-$5 billion a year — alongside the incentives from the Indian government and drive from customers to find alternatives to China. “If we don’t do it, this generation will die, and it will go. There’s nobody else who has that experience to do the entire cycle,” Kumar said in an interview. India has set up a budget of $9 billion to boost the local development of semiconductors and display manufacturing companies. The Modi government has approved four semiconductor units in the country to produce chips for applications such as automotive, consumer electronics, EVs, industrial and telecom. These four units will attract an investment of around $17.9 billion and have a cumulative capacity of producing about 70 million chips a day, per government estimates. For its part, four-month-old BigEndian initially plans surveillance chips, working with Taiwanese fab company UMC, with its reference chip based on a 28nm node process coming in the first quarter of 2025. The startup also plans to broaden its presence over time and look at the overall IoT market, predominantly led by 16- and 32-bit microcontrollers. Unlike a traditional fabless semiconductor company, BigEndian is working on building its platform-as-a-service model to help governments avoid Chinese middleware access, which is common among existing surveillance solutions. This model will bring software solutions to help manufacturers and customers customize how their surveillance cameras work. It will allow the startup to grow its revenues by offering these customizations as add-ons at a subscription. “India consumes about a billion of these chipsets a year,” said Kumar. “But these are all 50 cents to $1 kind of a chipset… If you go down the emerging automotive segment, a lot of 32-bit controllers go into automotives now… But we can’t dive into all these segments on day one because getting funding is a challenge in India.” To kick off, BigEndian has raised $3 million in an all-equity seed round led by Vertex Ventures SEA and India. Even though the seed funding is not enough for a fabless semiconductor startup to fulfill mass orders, Kumar asserted that the Indian government’s incentives to the industry help BigEndian, which has a workforce of about 16 people, with tailwinds and make it “almost like raising $5 million.” “Because this is a country that has not seen a big success in semiconductors, it is very, very unlikely that you’ll be able to raise at this stage. If I were in the U.S., we could actually raise close to about 12 to 15 million, but it’s not possible here, so you have to work with your constraints, and that’s what the challenges are. That’s probably also an entry barrier for us, [and] for other competition to come in,” he said. The round also included participation from strategic investors, including Amitabh Nagpal, head of startup business development at Amazon Web Services. This will help the startup raise bigger checks in the following rounds. BigEndian also plans not to limit itself to India as a market for its surveillance chips aimed at powering a wide range of middle to lower-end cameras. “Our objective is to create your bread and butter, prove to the market that a silicon company from India can come and then climb up the food chain as opposed to coming top down,” Kumar said."},

They realized that their former employers at Careem and Kitopi, as well as other local businesses in the region, struggled with payroll management and high compliance costs due to human error. Cercli , the startup they launched in January, addresses this challenge via software it developed that allows businesses in the MENA region to hire, manage and pay their global workforce. The potential of Cercli’s platform has attracted investor interest, leading to $4 million in seed funding led by San Francisco-based Afore Capital, marking the fund’s first deal in the region. Afore Capital backed Cercli, which claims to be building the “ Rippling for MENA,” because the founders are “building to solve for one of the region’s largest challenges: managing a global workforce while meeting compliance requirements,” managing partner Anamitra Banerji said. Azmi, who previously led operations at Kitopi and Careem, encountered this challenge firsthand while spearheading global expansion at cloud kitchen startup Kitopi, where he managed employee payroll across multiple countries. “I was doing what Deel was doing at Kitopi. When we launched in a new market, we would have to find an employee of record to pay folks that we would have to hire in those markets,” Azmi explained in an interview with TechCrunch. “And that is where I came across the pain point that we’re solving now, which is payroll and all of the adjacencies around it, where these companies did not have a system in place to run and process payroll across the entire workforce.” The ex-Kitopi director thought that if prominent tech startups in the region struggled with payroll inefficiencies, other companies, regardless of size, would likely face similar challenges. To validate this, he interviewed more than 30 companies, from Saudi Aramco, one of the world’s largest corporations, to a small mom-and-pop store in Dubai’s Karama area, to understand their payroll practices. Per his findings, smaller businesses often rely on spreadsheets, which are prone to data privacy risks, fraud and errors. Larger companies, on the other hand, spend millions on ERP solutions like Microsoft Dynamics, SAP or Oracle to manage payroll in-house. He, alongside Reche, the ex-CTO at London-based but Africa-focused sports-tech platform KingMakers, launched Cercli to unify payroll management across the region by replacing these outdated methods with a single platform. The platform, which aims to reduce human error and ensure full compliance for companies, has replaced individual HRIS systems and remote payroll solutions like Deel and RemotePass for several customers because it provides more efficient services, Azmi said. He explains why this is the case. Cercli initially focused on building a native payroll system for businesses to manage and pay employees locally. However, as the platform grew, clients began requesting remote payroll solutions. While global platforms like Deel or RemotePass were useful for managing remote contractor payroll or employee records, they weren’t reliable for handling local payroll needs. “They started asking if they could shift everything to our platform since the other systems couldn’t handle local payroll. This led us to develop two or three different systems to accommodate their global needs,” Azmi remarked. “Some customers were also using standalone HRIS products like BambooHR as their system of record. We combined these different systems but localized it for MENA businesses.” According to Azmi, compliance with specific labor laws and processing salaries for employees without bank accounts on behalf of clients are examples of how localization adds value, as payroll expenses that result from not meeting compliance requirements can be pretty significant. “Companies face the same challenge: lacking a single source of truth for their most valuable asset — their workforce — often one of the largest expenses on their P&L,” Azmi noted. Cercli focuses on mid-market enterprises, where it considers the need for integrated and compliant solutions across HR, finance, accounting, legal and IT is most pronounced. By adhering to the specific rules and laws of the MENA region, Cercli enables businesses with both local and global workforces to manage services like payroll, compliance, employee-of-record, expense reimbursements, onboarding and leave approvals. Azmi notes that the platform, which integrates with various workplace tools to streamline these processes, builds horizontally across multiple product verticals and markets. He owes this to his team, 80% of whom are in product and engineering, with prior experience at companies like Microsoft, ADP and Accenture. “I think where we’re closest to Rippling is we went very horizontal, building across the entire HR and payroll stack for businesses in the region. For us, this is the wedge into building a much larger product for customers to help automate all of that other manual, back-office work happening across their business,” said the co-founder. The startup, whose clientele includes companies with two to 500 employees, launched earlier this year and claims to have grown 25% month-on-month since January. So far, it has paid out more than $23 million in employee salaries across 31 countries. Demand for payroll and HR solutions is surging across emerging markets as global companies seek more value. Recent acquisitions highlight this trend: Last month, New York-based fintech Payoneer acquired Singapore-based global HR and payroll startup Skuad for $61 million. In March, Deel bought South Africa-based PaySpace for just over $100 million. While these acquisitions suggest that some emerging markets are ripe for consolidation, others, like the MENA region, are still developing. Azmi notes that PaySpace was acquired primarily for its payroll APIs, as Deel sought to leverage its experience in “codifying laws and regulations” across Africa. In contrast, no company has yet “codified regulations” in the MENA region, and Cercli aims to be among the first to achieve this. RemotePass — which recently localized its products for the MENA region — and Workpay, another YC-backed payroll company focused on Africa , could become competitors to Cercli should their products and markets intersect. Y Combinator participated in Cercli’s seed round, which included COTU Ventures and Rebel Fund. Several executives from Ramp, Rappi, Kitopi, Careem and Rippling also contributed to the round. The year-old payroll startup will use the funding to grow its team, build out adjacent products to serve other customer segments, including SMEs and enterprises, and expand its presence in core markets."},

Fleet is a good example of a company that has never raised outside capital but has been growing steadily. The Paris-based company originally offered a way to rent hardware, so instead of spending a small fortune to acquire a bunch of laptops for their employees, companies could use Fleet to lease devices and pay a monthly fee. The company is now launching several software services on top of its hardware-as-a-service proposition, from device management to cybersecurity and insurance. As a bootstrapped company, Fleet focused on optimizing its operations to remain as lean as possible and spend less money than it earns. For instance, the company doesn’t have a warehouse, as it sends devices directly to customers. Similarly, the company partners with financial institutions, letting them handle credit lines directly so that it doesn’t carry any risk in case of failed payments. In exchange, financial institutions can access a previously untapped market via Fleet. Over the years, the company has expanded to other products, such as smartphones, tablets, accessories, phone booths and furniture. However, it hasn’t been smooth sailing all along. The startup grew in parallel with the French tech ecosystem, which grew significantly for years. But just like in other ecosystems elsewhere in the world, startups in France have found it harder and harder to raise funding locally. Many companies have had to do several rounds of layoffs to stay afloat. “The slowdown in startup fundraising and also hiring, which we were able to predict during the second half of 2022, was quite worrying at first,” Fleet’s co-founder and CEO, Alexandre Berriche, told TechCrunch. “But in the end, I think that it was beneficial for us, as it encouraged us to diversify our revenue.” Did the startup think about raising money from a VC firm when its clients reduced their headcount to bridge the revenue gap? “No, never, even when we experienced a slowdown in 2023. Besides, I don’t think money is a magic solution to anything — at best, it’s a facilitator or accelerator. It doesn’t help you come up with the best possible strategy before raising,” Berriche said. Besides adding new products to its lineup, the company has tried to diversify its client base across industries and regions. Now, traditional, small and medium enterprises that aren’t backed by VCs make up the majority of Fleet’s clients, which are spread across 120 countries. Fleet now works with 1,500 companies and has around 100,000 users — its customers include Personio, SafetyWing, SumUp and Seedtag. It has offices in Paris, Barcelona and Berlin, and is about to open a new one in London. And July 2024 was Fleet’s best month ever when it comes to revenue. Having recent laptops that work is one thing, but making sure that they are properly managed is another important part of the typical IT department. That’s why Fleet is expanding to software and offering more services. For example, Fleet can distribute laptops and smartphones with a pre-installed mobile device management (MDM) solution, Omnissa’s Workspace One. Customers can also choose to get Bitdefender as a cybersecurity solution or Keeper as a password manager for their teams. Hofy is another company that has been working on turning IT into an outsourced service. The company was acquired by Deel , the remote hiring platform. Services like Fleet or Hofy make sense for many companies — especially when they have distributed teams. “Our vision is to become the one-stop shop for everything IT for SMBs. We believe that offering this all-in-one solution, in particular thanks to computer leasing, lets us gain a strategic position with our customers. We can support them in implementing best practices in terms of IT and cybersecurity,” Berriche said."},

The Netherlands’ data protection authority, Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (AP), said on Tuesday that it has imposed a penalty of €30.5 million — around $33.7 million at current exchange rates — on Clearview AI for a raft of breaches of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) after confirming the database contains images of Dutch citizens. This fine is larger than separate GDPR sanctions imposed by data protection authorities in France , Italy , Greece and the U.K. back in 2022. In a press release , the AP warned it has ordered an additional penalty of up to €5.1 million that will be levied for continued non-compliance, saying Clearview failed to stop the GDPR violations after the investigation concluded, which is why it has made the additional order. The total fine could hit €35.6 million if Clearview AI keeps ignoring the Netherlands regulator. The Dutch data protection authority began investigating Clearview AI in March 2023 after it received complaints from three individuals related to the company’s failure to comply with data access requests. The GDPR gives EU residents a set of rights related to their personal data, which includes the right to request a copy of their data or have it deleted. Clearview AI has not been complying with such requests. Other GDPR violations the AP is sanctioning Clearview AI for include the salient one of building a database by collecting people’s biometric data without a valid legal basis. It is also being sanctioned for GDPR transparency failings. “Clearview should never have built the database with photos, the unique biometric codes and other information linked to them,” the AP wrote. “This especially applies for the [face-derived unique biometric] codes. Like fingerprints, these are biometric data. Collecting and using them is prohibited. There are some statutory exceptions to this prohibition, but Clearview cannot rely on them.” The company also failed to inform the individuals whose personal data it scraped and added to its database, per the decision. Reached for comment, Clearview representative Lisa Linden of the Washington, D.C.-based PR firm Resilere Partners did not respond to questions but emailed TechCrunch a statement that’s attributed to Clearview’s chief legal officer, Jack Mulcaire. “Clearview AI does not have a place of business in the Netherlands or the EU, it does not have any customers in the Netherlands or the EU, and does not undertake any activities that would otherwise mean it is subject to the GDPR,” Mulcaire wrote, adding: “This decision is unlawful, devoid of due process and is unenforceable.” According to the Dutch regulator, the company cannot appeal the penalty as it failed to object to the decision. It’s also worth noting that the GDPR is extraterritorial in scope, meaning it applies to the processing of personal data of EU people wherever that processing takes place. U.S.-based Clearview uses people’s scraped data to sell an identity-matching service to customers that can include government agencies, law enforcement and other security services. However, its clients are increasingly unlikely to hail from the EU, where use of the privacy law-breaking tech risks regulatory sanction — something which happened to a Swedish police authority back in 2021 . The AP warned that it will rigorously sanction any Dutch entities that seek to use Clearview AI. “Clearview breaks the law, and this makes using the services of Clearview illegal. Dutch organisations that use Clearview may therefore expect hefty fines from the Dutch DPA,” wrote Dutch DPA chairman, Aleid Wolfsen. An English language version of the AP’s decision can be accessed via this link . Clearview AI has faced a raft of GDPR penalties over the past several years (on paper, it has amassed a total of about €100 million in EU privacy fines), but regional data protection authorities apparently haven’t been very successful at collecting any of these fines. The U.S.-based company remains uncooperative and has not appointed a legal representative in the EU. More importantly, Clearview AI has not changed its GDPR-violating behavior — it has continued to flout European privacy laws with apparent operational impunity on account of being based elsewhere. The Dutch AP is concerned about this, saying it is exploring ways to ensure Clearview stops breaking the law. The regulator is looking into whether the company’s directors can be held personally responsible for the violations. “Such a company cannot continue to violate the rights of Europeans and get away with it. Certainly not in this serious manner and on this massive scale. We are now going to investigate if we can hold the management of the company personally liable and fine them for directing those violations,” wrote Wolfsen. “That liability already exists if directors know that the GDPR is being violated, have the authority to stop that, but omit to do so, and in this way consciously accept those violations.” Since we’ve just seen the founder of messaging app Telegram, Pavel Durov, arrested on French soil over allegations of illegal content being spread on his platform, it’s interesting to consider whether sanctioning the people managing Clearview might have a greater chance of driving compliance — they may wish to travel freely to and around the EU, after all."},

A startup called Doccla is bringing technology to bear to address the issue: It’s building “virtual bed” tech to help doctors remotely manage patients who have either been discharged early, or in some cases never go to the hospital at all. After gaining traction in the U.K. and Ireland, it’s now raised £35 million ($46 million) to expand in Europe. Lakestar is leading the Series B round; Elaia and several existing investors are also participating. The funding comes two years after Doccla raised a $17 million Series A . Doccla, which competes with companies like Graphnet and Huma among others, will use the funding in part to hire local teams in new markets. And while the startup’s main focus up to now has been to contract with health services — they include local NHS Trusts in the U.K and Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) — for “virtual bed” tech for patients, it is also supporting virtual clinical trials for pharmaceutics companies; and it has its eye on building a data insights business around all of it. Doccla’s start came out of COVID-19 headwinds: A big push to keep more people out of hospitals to reduce resource strain led healthcare organizations to sign on to virtual bed solutions like Doccla’s to plug the gap. But as life started to return to normal, the startup also pursued more practical growth strategies. “It’s in our DNA to be revenue-first,” Doccla’s co-founder Martin Ratz said in an interview. At its core, Doccla’s service is organized around a set of monitoring devices provided to patients along with a mobile phone pre-loaded with its app. These are used to collect data that gets loaded directly into electronic health records. Doctors view the data via a clinician dashboard, and they get special alerts when diagnostic readings need more attention — a strong selling point for overworked staff, and peace of mind for patients at home. Ratz told TechCrunch that it’s taken a very practical approach to entering new markets: It typically signs a new customer there before it does so. “First we sell, and then we enter the market with the help of a customer; that’s exactly what happened in Germany,” he said in an interview, adding that it already has plans to do so in Austria and France. “We’re aiming to replicate what we do in the U.K. [while] recognizing that the underpinnings of [newer] markets are very different, particularly in terms of reimbursement,” he said. On the pharma side, Doccla’s “hospital at home” technology is being used in drug research. Specifically, during drug trials, Doccla is reducing or replacing the need for patients to physically attend clinics, typically run by third-party contract research organizations, to monitor their progress. “We can help do things faster, better, cheaper than traditional CROs,” said Ratz. The market for virtual hospital solutions is becoming crowded, but Doccla believes details like being device agnostic will help it stay the course. And while Doccla requires an app, it emphasizes accessibility, with large fonts and a simple interface. It also offers in-app messaging and video calls with live clinicians — both with those who are staffing your physical clinic, but also clinicians from Doccla itself."},

Three years later, the Dubai-based startup, which now counts 50,000 retail and business customers after expanding its offerings to meet the needs of micro, small and medium-sized businesses in the UAE, has netted $22 million in Series A funding led by Altos Ventures. Indeed, such sizable follow-on funding despite the global funding slowdown underscores investors’ confidence in the fintech company’s growth — the company claims 34% month-over-month growth in customers for the last year, and says its revenues have increased ten-fold over the same period. Co-founder and CEO Faisal Toukan told TechCrunch that three factors made Ziina particularly exciting to investors. They include the rapidly expanding SME segment in the UAE, its focus on product-led growth and its recently acquired central bank license. Ziina originated as a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment app for splitting bills, such as for group trips or rent. While the app gained traction with retail customers in the UAE, some who ran businesses sought to use the digital wallet to send and receive payments, too, according to Toukan. In response, Ziina organically expanded its platform into two segments: Ziina Personal for splitting bills among friends and Ziina Business for collecting payments. The first business feature allowed users to send payment links and get paid through Apple Pay, Google Pay, Mastercard and Visa. As demand from businesses increased, Ziina developed more products for them: a payment gateway (checkout) integrated with platforms like WooCommerce and Shopify for online payments, point-of-sale (POS) solutions for in-person payments using QR codes and payments via social media. In addition to these features, Ziina added CRM functions so businesses can track customer details and interactions. The YC-backed startup continues to offer its P2P service, but it’s clear why most of its product focus is now on small businesses. The startup targets an underserved market of 560,000 SMEs in the UAE, which account for over 94% of all companies and contribute about 60% of the country’s GDP . As of 2023, around 77% of SMEs in the UAE had adopted digital payments, fueling the growing demand for financial management tools. “We’re an all-in-one platform for businesses to get paid in the UAE, having evolved from being purely a consumer app to an ecosystem that connects consumers and businesses for payments under one platform,” Toukan explained on the call. “We look at the general experience as consumers can pay businesses, businesses can pay consumers, and then build that network effect across the two customer segments. And that is one of the key differentiators we have in our product strategy and business. So basically, everything should be under one ecosystem where people have a financially trusted partner.” From a product standpoint, Ziina says it addresses three critical pain points for SMEs in the payments space: accessibility, cost transparency and user experience. Regarding accessibility, SMEs can use the fintech to open accounts and set up a payment processor in minutes instead of weeks. In terms of cost, Ziina says it offers straightforward pricing with no hidden fees — 2.6% plus 1 AED (about US$ 0.25) for each payment link and POS transaction, and 2.9% plus 1 AED for each payment gateway transaction. Lastly, customers have a dashboard to track and reconcile online and offline payments and payment links. With Ziina’s rapid growth over the last year, it now serves 50,000 active users, including both retail and business customers; its business customers cut across fashion and gaming to travel and tourism. Toukan also tells TechCrunch that the startup now processes about 1,050 dirhams ($280) every 60 seconds and is on track to handle 1.1 billion dirhams (~$300 million) in annualized transaction volume, up from 550 million dirhams (~$150 million) last year. Ziina’s growth has come primarily through product-led efforts without a dedicated sales team. According to the chief executive, 55% of its customers have come organically, while the rest have come from B2B referrals. However, as it continues to scale and provide more financial services off the back of the banking license it received, that’ll likely change. The company is onboarding its first sales hires, including some from Revolut. Ziina claims to be the first venture-backed startup with the stored value facility (SVF) license from the Central Bank of the UAE. This allows the fintech to offer more financial solutions — excluding lending, which requires a separate license — and earn revenue from the float when customers keep assets on the platform, for example. Toukan believes that this license and financial ecosystem of products (the fintech is venturing into expense management soon with the launch of its card product, ZiiCard) gives Ziina an edge over other regional fintechs that provide overlapping financial services. Paymob , for instance, provides POS terminals; Tabby is growing its financial offerings outside of buy now, pay later; Telda offers P2P payments; and Mamo is in the spend management business. Despite this competition, the chief executive, who founded the fintech with Sarah Toukan and Andrew Gold , sees ample market potential for Ziina in the rapidly growing payments sector for consumers and businesses across the MENA region. “The Middle East seems to be growing quite strongly, especially regarding GDP growth. And the UAE is one of the pioneers in that,” the CEO remarked. “If we at Ziina do our jobs correctly, which we’re quite excited about, we should be able to have 200,000 monthly active businesses on the platform four years from now, given the rise of SMEs in the UAE. And if you look at players like Nubank in Brazil, they hit those targets of between 10 to 20% market penetration. So we intend to do that and be the Nubank of the region.” The Series A round included participation from Activant Capital, Avenir Growth, FinTech Collective, FJ Labs, Jabbar Internet Group, Middle East Venture Partners and Y Combinator. This brings Ziina’s total venture raised to over $30 million since its inception in 2020."},

You can read about them here . Outside of sci-fi films, there’s no precedent for AI systems killing people or being used in massive cyberattacks. However, some lawmakers want to implement safeguards before bad actors make that dystopian future a reality. A California bill, known as SB 1047, tries to stop real-world disasters caused by AI systems before they happen. It passed the state’s senate in August, and now awaits an approval or veto from California Governor Gavin Newsom. While this seems like a goal we can all agree on, SB 1047 has drawn the ire of Silicon Valley players large and small, including venture capitalists, big tech trade groups, researchers and startup founders. A lot of AI bills are flying around the country right now, but California’s Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act has become one of the most controversial. Here’s why. SB 1047 tries to prevent large AI models from being used to cause “critical harms” against humanity. The bill gives examples of “critical harms” as a bad actor using an AI model to create a weapon that results in mass casualties, or instructing one to orchestrate a cyberattack causing more than $500 million in damages (for comparison, the CrowdStrike outage is estimated to have caused upwards of $5 billion). The bill makes developers — that is, the companies that develop the models — liable for implementing sufficient safety protocols to prevent outcomes like these. SB 1047’s rules would only apply to the world’s largest AI models: ones that cost at least $100 million and use 10^26 FLOPS (floating point operations, a way of measuring computation) during training. That’s a huge amount of compute, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said GPT-4 cost about this much to train. These thresholds could be raised as needed. Very few companies today have developed public AI products large enough to meet those requirements, but tech giants such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft are likely to very soon. AI models — essentially, massive statistical engines that identify and predict patterns in data — have generally become more accurate as they’ve grown larger, a trend many expect to continue. Mark Zuckerberg recently said the next generation of Meta’s Llama will require 10x more compute , which would put it under the authority of SB 1047. When it comes to open source models and their derivatives, the bill determined the original developer is responsible unless another developer spends another $10 million creating a derivative of the original model. The bill also requires a safety protocol to prevent misuses of covered AI products, including an “emergency stop” button that shuts down the entire AI model. Developers must also create testing procedures that address risks posed by AI models, and must hire third-party auditors annually to assess their AI safety practices. The result must be “reasonable assurance” that following these protocols will prevent critical harms — not absolute certainty, which is of course impossible to provide. A new California agency, the Board of Frontier Models, would oversee the rules. Every new public AI model that meets SB 1047’s thresholds must be individually certified with a written copy of its safety protocol. The Board of Frontier Models, would be governed by nine people, including representatives from the AI industry, open source community and academia, appointed by California’s governor and legislature. The board will advise California’s attorney general on potential violations of SB 1047, and issue guidance to AI model developers on safety practices. A developer’s chief technology officer must submit an annual certification to the board assessing its AI model’s potential risks, how effective its safety protocol is and a description of how the company is complying with SB 1047. Similar to breach notifications, if an “AI safety incident” occurs, the developer must report it to the FMD within 72 hours of learning about the incident. If a developer’s safety measures are found insufficient, SB 1047 allows California’s attorney general to bring an injunctive order against the developer. That could mean the developer would have to cease operating or training its model. If an AI model is actually found to be used in a catastrophic event, California’s attorney general can sue the company. For a model costing $100 million to train, penalties could reach up to $10 million on the first violation and $30 million on subsequent violations. That penalty rate scales as AI models become more expensive. Lastly, the bill includes whistleblower protections for employees if they try to disclose information about an unsafe AI model to California’s attorney general. California State Senator Scott Wiener, who authored the bill and represents San Francisco, tells TechCrunch that SB 1047 is an attempt to learn from past policy failures with social media and data privacy, and protect citizens before it’s too late. “We have a history with technology of waiting for harms to happen, and then wringing our hands,” said Wiener. “Let’s not wait for something bad to happen. Let’s just get out ahead of it.” Even if a company trains a $100 million model in Texas, or for that matter France, it will be covered by SB 1047 as long as it does business in California. Wiener says Congress has done “remarkably little legislating around technology over the last quarter century,” so he thinks it’s up to California to set a precedent here. When asked whether he’s met with OpenAI and Meta on SB 1047, Wiener says “we’ve met with all the large labs.” Two AI researchers who are sometimes called the “godfathers of AI,” Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, have thrown their support behind this bill. These two belong to a faction of the AI community concerned about the dangerous, doomsday scenarios that AI technology could cause. These “AI doomers” have existed for a while in the research world, and SB 1047 could codify some of their preferred safeguards into law. Another group sponsoring SB 1047, the Center for AI Safety, wrote an open letter in May 2023 asking the world to prioritize “mitigating the risk of extinction from AI” as seriously as pandemics or nuclear war. “This is in the long-term interest of industry in California and the US more generally because a major safety incident would likely be the biggest roadblock to further advancement,” said director of the Center for AI Safety, Dan Hendrycks, in an email to TechCrunch. Recently, Hendrycks’ own motivations have been called into question . In July, he publicly launched a startup, Gray Swan, which builds “tools to help companies assess the risks of their AI systems,” according to a press release . Following criticisms that Hendrycks’ startup could stand to gain if the bill passes, potentially as one of the auditors SB 1047 requires developers to hire, he divested his equity stake in Gray Swan. “I divested in order to send a clear signal,” said Hendrycks in an email to TechCrunch. “If the billionaire VC opposition to commonsense AI safety wants to show their motives are pure, let them follow suit.” After several of Anthropic’s suggested amendments were added to SB 1047, CEO Dario Amodei issued a letter saying the bill’s “benefits likely outweigh its costs.” It’s not an endorsement, but it’s a lukewarm signal of support. Shortly after that, Elon Musk signaled he was in favor of the bill. A growing chorus of Silicon Valley players oppose SB 1047. Hendrycks’ “billionaire VC opposition” likely refers to a16z, the venture firm founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, which has strongly opposed SB 1047. In early August, the venture firm’s chief legal officer, Jaikumar Ramaswamy, submitted a letter to Senator Wiener, claiming the bill “will burden startups because of its arbitrary and shifting thresholds,” creating a chilling effect on the AI ecosystem. As AI technology advances, it will get more expensive, meaning that more startups will cross that $100 million threshold and will be covered by SB 1047; a16z says several of their startups already receive that much for training models. Fei-Fei Li, often called the godmother of AI, broke her silence on SB 1047 in early August, writing in a Fortune column that the bill will “harm our budding AI ecosystem.” While Li is a well-regarded pioneer in AI research from Stanford, she also reportedly created an AI startup called World Labs in April, valued at a billion dollars and backed by a16z. She joins influential AI academics such as fellow Stanford researcher Andrew Ng, who called the bill “an assault on open source” during a speech at a Y Combinator event in July. Open source models may create additional risk for their creators, since like any open software, they are more easily modified and deployed to arbitrary and potentially malicious purposes. Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, said SB 1047 would hurt research efforts, and is based on an “illusion of ‘existential risk’ pushed by a handful of delusional think-tanks,” in a post on X . Meta’s Llama LLM is one of the foremost examples of an open source LLM. Startups are also not happy about the bill. Jeremy Nixon, CEO of AI startup Omniscience and founder of AGI House SF, a hub for AI startups in San Francisco, worries that SB 1047 will crush his ecosystem. He argues that bad actors should be punished for causing critical harms, not the AI labs that openly develop and distribute the technology. “There is a deep confusion at the center of the bill, that LLMs can somehow differ in their levels of hazardous capability,” said Nixon. “It’s more than likely, in my mind, that all models have hazardous capabilities as defined by the bill.” OpenAI opposed SB 1047 in late August, noting that national security measures related to AI models should be regulated at the federal level. They’ve supported a federal bill that would do so. But Big Tech, which the bill directly focuses on, is panicked about SB 1047 as well. The Chamber of Progress — a trade group representing Google, Apple, Amazon and other Big Tech giants — issued an open letter opposing the bill saying SB 1047 restrains free speech and “pushes tech innovation out of California.” Last year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other tech executives endorsed the idea of federal AI regulation . U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, released a statement opposing SB 1047 in August. He expressed concerns the bill “would be ineffective, punishing of individual entrepreneurs and small businesses, and hurt California’s spirit of innovation.” He’s since been joined by speaker Nancy Pelosi and the United States Chamber of Commerce, who have also said the bill would hurt innovation. Silicon Valley doesn’t traditionally like when California sets broad tech regulation like this. In 2019, Big Tech pulled a similar card when another state privacy bill , California’s Consumer Privacy Act, also threatened to change the tech landscape. Silicon Valley lobbied against that bill , and months before it went into effect, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and 50 other executives wrote an open letter calling for a federal privacy bill instead. SB 1047 currently sits on California Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk where he will ultimately decide whether to sign the bill into law before the end of August. Wiener says he has not spoken to Newsom about the bill, and does not know his position. This bill would not go into effect immediately, as the Board of Frontier Models is set to be formed in 2026. Further, if the bill does pass, it’s very likely to face legal challenges before then, perhaps from some of the same groups that are speaking up about it now. Correction: This story originally referenced a previous draft of SB 1047’s language around who is responsible for fine-tuned models. Currently, SB 1047 says the developer of a derivative model is only responsible for a model if they spend three times as much as the original model developer did on training."},

It turns out investors have already proven they are willing to value the company that high to get on OpenAI’s coveted cap table. Multiple companies that track or facilitate secondaries deals — where investors buy shares from existing investors, not directly from the company — have seen investors pay prices that indicate an over $100 billion valuation. The primary deal that OpenAI is negotiating would reportedly be led by Josh Kushner’s Thrive Capital, which would put in $1 billion, according to Journal reporting, with Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple, being rumored as investors as well. This would be quite the step up for the AI leader. The company was most recently valued at $86 billion in a secondary sale involving existing stakes in September, Bloomberg reported . Still, securities trader Rainmaker Securities has seen investors bidding on OpenAI stock at prices that value the company up to $143 billion. Caplight, a secondary data tracking platform, estimates that the company is currently worth more than $111 billion based on both secondaries activity and past traditional financing rounds. “There are a lot of investors that really want to be part of this story and want to be an investor in this company,” Glen Anderson, co-founder and managing partner at Rainmaker Securities, told TechCrunch. “So a $100 billion valuation, is it rich? Maybe. But, I mean, if OpenAI can live up to [its] potential, it may be a steal.” Greg Martin, a co-founder and managing director at Rainmaker Securities, added that while the company valuation has risen quickly, so has its revenue. While OpenAI still reportedly burns a ton of cash, he said it’s worth noting that the company went from having $0 in revenue just a few years ago to having billions today. The company is tracking to hit $2 billion in ARR by the end of the year, according to The Information . “Obviously it is hard to put a proper valuation on OpenAI, but we are seeing a lot of demand,” Martin said. “There is a fear of missing out on the premium the company is getting. There is certainly a cogent argument that the company could be worth a trillion dollars some day.” While OpenAI’s next official valuation is still yet to be determined, one thing is already for sure — this funding round will spark more secondaries activity around OpenAI and other AI competitors, Martin said. He predicts it will also give a valuation boost to companies including Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face and more. “It generates buzz. It generates excitement. It resets market expectations,” Martin said."},

Earlier this month, X closed its operations in Brazil in protest against court orders asking it to remove accounts that allegedly spread misinformation. At the time, the company said Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes “threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders.” Moraes warned X earlier this week that Brazil would ban the service if the company did not name a legal representative in the country. “Soon, we expect Judge Alexandre de Moraes will order X to be shut down in Brazil, simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents,” said X’s global affairs team in a tweet Friday morning.

It’s even harder at scale for a large organization. As we’ve watched large organizations over the last 15 years try to embrace mobile, Big Data, the cloud and general digital transformation, we have seen many of them struggle again and again to implement these technologies. Today, it’s AI that is forcing companies and their employees to change, whether they like it or not. Part of the problem is technical debt , the notion that an organization’s tech stack has to evolve to take full advantage of the new technologies, rather than using a set of technical capabilities designed for a prior era. It’s not easy to try and change something that is fundamental to running a business without risking messing up what works already. Not too many managers are going to fully embrace that kind of change. Substantive change involves tremendous risk along with enormous potential. Another part of the problem is institutional inertia. It’s just hard to change how people do things. Let me tell you the story of when I was a technical writer many years ago, and we were implementing a computer system at a small town register of deeds. The town’s deeds were on paper and filed in cabinets. It was manual and unwieldy, making tracing deeds a process that could take weeks because people had to manually dig through the paper morass. The computer system was clearly better, but the workers at the front desk who dealt with the public weren’t sold. Part of their job was to stamp completed documents with a rubber stamp, which they did with great gusto, before they were sent away to be filed. For these clerks, who had worked the counter for 20 or 30 years, the stamp represented their identity and sense of power. They didn’t want to give it up. Eventually, the system architect just simply gave in and let them keep their stamp. Even though it was really no longer required for an online system, it got them to buy into the change. Which brings us to the biggest problem of all: change management. The hardest component of implementing new technology isn’t shopping, buying, testing and implementing it. It’s getting people to use it, and you often have to let them keep their stamp or they are going to sabotage even the best intentions of the team implementing the solution. Think about all of that, and then consider the level of change that AI brings, and you see a much more radical adjustment on the horizon around the way we work. The people holding the stamps see their power slipping away, and you have to be careful not to alienate them or you could be flushing money down the drain. In the end, organizations are people and people are messy, and you have to look beyond the tech to the end goal: implementing new software that could transform the business. Large technological shifts inside organizations are nothing new. The advent of the PC in the 1980s and the rise of the spreadsheet and word processor was one such moment. The internet and World Wide Web was another, but AI could be bigger than these previous waves of change. “The internet era lowered the cost of information transmission, and CIOs rode that thing and brought digital technologies inside of their organizations and so forth. But AI is a markedly different type of technology. It’s lowering the cost of expertise,” Karim Lakhani, faculty chair at Harvard’s Digital Data Design Institute, told TechCrunch. Box CEO Aaron Levie takes it one step further, saying this is the first time that a computer is doing the work a person did previously, rather than helping the person do that work more efficiently. “So it’s a new relationship with computers because computers are making judgment decisions. They’re assessing information. They’re working through our data in ways that like a human would,” Levie said, and companies need to start rethinking about the role of computing in the organization. “There’s a whole new set of frameworks and paradigms that we have to evolve as a result of what AI can now do inside of an enterprise context,” he said. That means starting to think about how this technology will affect the organization overall and looking at issues like answer accuracy, data leakage, what data is used to train models and so forth. Of course, Levie thinks his company’s platform has been built to deal with these issues and help customers work through them, but companies are dealing with multiple vendors telling them a similar story, and it tends to make it more difficult to find the ones that can truly help and add value. One big problem facing organizations is figuring out whether generative AI is really delivering on the promise of increased productivity; there currently isn’t a good way to make a direct connection between GenAI capabilities and increased productivity. That makes it harder to sell this internally to skeptical workers, who might be concerned about their own futures as they implement AI. On the flip side, there will be employees demanding these new tools, and that tension could create further organizational stress as managers work to figure out how to implement AI across a company with a range of opinions about how it will affect work. Some people like Jamin Ball, partner at Altimeter Capital, have written that the technology is so transformative that companies have to take the leap, whether they see the immediate benefits or not. “Right now the world is evolving — AI is a massive platform shift. And by NOT adopting / spending on it, you risk losing market share and slowly becoming irrelevant,” he wrote in his Clouded Judgement newsletter in July. Rita Sallam, a Gartner analyst, says if you look back at the days of the first word processors, the value proposition was never really about saving money by taking out the secretarial pool. It helped create a new way of working — and AI brings a similar value proposition. “Cutting out the secretarial pool probably didn’t justify that cost. But when you think about removing the physical limitation to ideation, of writing your ideas and iterating your ideas, and then giving that to everyone in the organization, my guess is, though we can’t prove it, it unleashed a whole era of potential innovation, and the ability for people now to curate their thoughts in a whole different way,” she said. Those kinds of changes are hard to measure, but they are huge benefits nonetheless. Getting executive buy-in has always been a crucial piece of the digital transformation puzzle. Like PCs before them, the cloud transformed how companies did business. Lakhani says AI is different from the cloud because CEOs can get this by using it. It doesn’t require any real technical explanation to see its power, and that could help drive change inside organizations. “My sense is that I think what’s different and what is accelerating the hype is that the Davos crowd of CEOs and board members and people that influence corporate strategy and so forth now have access to these tools, and can start to see some of their own problems being solved this way,” he said. But that doesn’t mean that vendors can simply pour into organizations and sell their solutions. They have to figure out how to show value.“The hyperscalers and vendors have to do a better job of showing how organizations can actually adopt this stuff,” he said. But getting past the people problem will be an even bigger hurdle. Lakhani says there are three truisms in place as organizations undertake this challenge. First of all, he says, “Machines won’t replace humans, but humans with machines will replace humans without machines.” Secondly, he says, “AI will fail at the front lines if you don’t think about the change mandate as top down, and create the incentives for the ‘stamp makers’ to actually adopt and feel good about what they’re doing.” He says if you try to ram it down their throats, it’s going to fail, so you have to define for everyone how and why to change, and not use the ‘because I said so’ approach. Nobody says this is going to be easy. Organizations have different levels of maturity and different degrees of technological readiness. But people are people, and substantive change doesn’t come easily inside large companies. AI is going to test organizational flexibility more than any other technology has in the past, and it’s not hyperbole to suggest that some companies could live and die on how deftly they handle it."},
{"category": "Media & Entertainment", "title": "Before Midjourney, there was NightCafe — and it’s still kicking", "date": "2024-08-31", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/31/before-midjourney-there-was-nightcafe-and-its-still-kicking/", "content": "Elle Russell, co-founder of NightCafe , which offers a suite of AI-powered art-creating tools, prefers to avoid the spotlight. “I like to remain hidden behind my monitors,” she told me in a recent interview. NightCafe, based in Cairns, Australia, is similarly low profile. The company, which Russell helped her partner, Angus Russell, launch five years ago, doesn’t get the same publicity as some of its rivals, like Midjourney . Yet NightCafe — an entirely bootstrapped venture that’s profitable “most months,” according to Elle — has enormous reach. Its over 25 million users have created nearly a billion images with its tools. To pull back the curtain on one of the web’s oldest generative art marketplaces, I spoke with Elle about NightCafe’s origins, some of the challenges the platform faces, and where she and Angus see it evolving from here. As NightCafe’s founding story goes, Angus had recently moved into a semi-detached house in Sydney’s Inner West area and hadn’t had a chance to decorate it with much artwork. “You should get some art; the walls are bare,” remarked one guest. And while Angus agreed, he couldn’t find any prints online that spoke to him. So in 2019, Angus, who had a degree in design and who’d co-founded a few design-focused startups, began a side hustle: a website where people could buy and sell AI-generated art. He called it NightCafe, after Vincent Van Gogh’s “The Night Café.” It was an abject failure. People liked creating the art, which NightCafe didn’t charge for. But they didn’t want to pay for wall prints, which was the only way the site made money. Then one fateful week, Angus noticed that his hosting bill was a few hundred dollars higher than usual. Someone had generated thousands of images in just a few days. He implemented a credit system to prevent that from happening again. Soon after, Angus’ inbox was flooded with requests to add an option to buy more credits, which he did. Practically overnight, the site became breakeven. It’s at this point Elle joined NightCafe to run the business side of the operation. “I have two undergraduate bachelor degrees, in business and communications, and I’m also a CPA,” she said. “It made sense.” NightCafe got its second big break a couple years later, in mid-2021, when OpenAI announced DALL-E . DALL-E, OpenAI’s first image-generating AI model, was state-of-the-art for the time. OpenAI opted not to release it, but it wasn’t long before enthusiasts managed to reverse-engineer some of the methods behind DALL-E and build open source models of their own. Angus, who’d been closely following the developments, quickly worked to get one of the more popular DALL-E alternatives, VQGAN+CLIP, on NightCafe. He shelled out for hundreds of GPUs to scale it up. The investment soon paid for itself. Images created with NightCafe’s VQGAN+CLIP blew up on Reddit; NightCafe made $17,000 in a single day. Angus decided to quit his job at Atlassian to work on the platform full-time. The NightCafe of today is quite different from the NightCafe of several years ago. The platform still runs some models on its own servers, including recent versions of Stable Diffusion and Ideogram. But it also integrates APIs from AI vendors that offer them, delivering what amounts to custom interfaces for third-party generators. That is to say, NightCafe layers tools on top of models from elsewhere, including OpenAI, Google and Black Forest Labs . And, as it has since 2019, the site provides printing services for customers who want mugs, T-shirts and prints of any art they generate. “We’re a UI and community company,” Elle said. “NightCafe doesn’t have any internal AI or machine learning capability; we aggregate the available image models and make them fun and accessible to use.” In NightCafe’s chatrooms, users can share their art and collaborate, or kick off “AI art challenges.” The platform also hosts official competitions where people can submit their creations for featured placement. Last year, NightCafe introduced fine-tuning, which allows users to train a model to re-create a specific style, face or object by uploading example images. Fine-tuned models on NightCafe are subject to certain restrictions; for example, they can’t be trained on images showing nudity, celebrities or people under the age of 18, and they must be manually approved by NightCafe’s moderation team. (That’s to mitigate the risk of deepfakes.) NightCafe is free to use, but only up to a certain number of images. Packs of image-generation credits can be purchased à la cart, and select features are gated behind a subscription. For fees ranging from $4.79 to $50 per month (undercutting Midjourney and Civitai ), users get priority access to more-capable models, the ability to tip creators, the aforementioned fine-tuning capability and a higher image-generation limit. It’s a model that’s worked exceptionally well for NightCafe. A source close to the company tells TechCrunch that NightCafe is raking in $4 million in annualized revenue with a gross margin of nearly 50%, meaning that NightCafe is generating approximately $2 million a year in profit after expenses (inclusive of payroll for its nine staff). Roughly a million people are visiting NightCafe each month, Elle says, and 20,000 have a subscription. “Any AI art generator online is competing for money from the same people, though our users skew older than a lot of the industry,” she said. “We consider our biggest competitors to be other apps that have a strong community: Leonardo, Civitai and Midjourney.” By opting not to train its own AI (and moderating fine-tuning), NightCafe is attempting to steer clear of the legal stand-off that’s ensnared many of the AI vendors whose models it aggregates. Stability AI , Midjourney and a pair of other model providers, DeviantArt and Runway , face a class action lawsuit filed by artists who allege that the vendors engaged in copyright infringement by training their models on art without permission. (The vendors claim a fair use defense .) Some parts of the suit have been struck down. But a federal judge allowed it to move into the discovery stage early this month. NightCafe may be protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which holds users, not platforms, liable for illegal content (like copyright-violating artwork) so long as the platforms remove the content upon request. Australia, NightCafe’s home base, has the Broadcasting Services Act, which closely mirrors Section 230 with the exception that it imposes higher additional fees for failing to expeditiously remove “extreme violent material.” Of course, should a court rule that the models NightCafe uses are essentially plagiarism machines, that’d be disruptive to the company’s business. But what about copyright as it pertains to NightCafe’s users and the art they generate? According to the platform’s terms of service, users retain the copyright for their AI-generated works in countries that recognize these types of works as copyrightable (like the U.S.) — at least as long as there’s permission to use any third-party branding, logos or trademarks within. A post last May on NightCafe’s blog sheds more light on this: “Legitimate creators recognize and acknowledge where the inspiration used to create their images derived from another source. AI art creation tools are also evolving quickly, with systems in development to support the ongoing creative environment while ensuring that users can only access source material with the [consent] of the original artist — in much the same way that a royalty-free photography image may be permitted for use provided the creator is referenced.” In other words, in NightCafe’s view, it’s the users, not NightCafe, who have to cover their bases. And if they don’t, the platform won’t defend them from the wrath of IP holders. But it seems that IP holders don’t intimidate many users. Cursory searches of NightCafe bring up images of Pokémon and Donald Duck , celebrities like Britney S pears , brands such as Coca-Cola and LEGO and artwork in the style of artists like Stanley “Artgerm” Lau . None appears to have been generated with the blessing of the copyright holders. “Users can also report content that got through automated filters, and we have a team of human moderators working 24/7 on moderating flagged content,” Elle said when asked about this. As my interview with Elle segued to moderation, we dove into NightCafe’s general content guidelines, particularly its policies around politics and deepfakes. Platforms, including Midjourney, have taken the step of banning users from generating images of political figures like Donald Trump and Kamala Harris leading up to the U.S. presidential election. But NightCafe hasn’t — and it doesn’t intend to, according to Elle. “Generating images of Trump and other political and public figures is allowed,” she said. “However, we don’t want NightCafe to be a place for political arguments.” How can NightCafe have it both ways? While the platform won’t prevent users from publishing political images elsewhere, it will flag those images for review if a user tries to post them to NightCafe’s public feeds. That being the case, it’s trivial to find images of Biden in a wheelchair , Trump holding a gun and questionable Harris memes in NightCafe’s public gallery. With polls showing that the majority of Americans are concerned about the spread of AI propaganda and deepfakes, NightCafe certainly hasn’t made enforcement easier on itself. As for what content is or isn’t allowed: It depends. “Political bait,” glorification of divisive figures or purposely unflattering or demeaning images, are no-gos (in spite of what my searches turned up). Most content the average person would find harmful or offensive is also prohibited; NightCafe’s community standards list calls out things like racist and homophobic images, spam, offensive swear words, terrorism themes, images mocking people with disabilities, and depictions of hate groups and symbols. These subjects may technically be disallowed. But type a term like “suicide bomber” into NightCafe’s search bar and there’s a decent chance you’ll come across at least one image that seems to fly in the face of the platform’s rules. Elle tells me that it’s ultimately up to moderators to interpret NightCafe’s guidelines and that repeatedly publishing images in a banned category, or circumventing automated filters, could result in a warning or ban. NightCafe has a rather small moderation team given its size (and the fact that the site’s users generate at least 700 images a day): five paid moderators and 20 volunteer moderators who get compensation in the form of premium NightCafe features. The paid moderators monitor content, while the volunteers handle comments, NightCafe’s chatrooms and the fine-tuned model queue. Considering the poor working conditions content moderators are often subject to, I asked Elle for more information about NightCafe’s moderator recruitment practices. She said that the paid team is run through an outsourcing firm based in Indonesia (she wouldn’t name which) and overseen by an internal NightCafe staff member. All paid moderators get a “market wage,” Elle said. (In Jakarta, the minimum wage was around $325 per month as of early 2024.) Similar to Civitai, NightCafe has a policy carve-out for “NSFW” content: short of outright nudity, but permissive of suggestive poses (with “bare breasts and bums”), blood and gore, graphic depictions of war, and images of illegal drug use (e.g., Mickeys smoking blunts ). This is somewhat dependent on the model; OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 has a stricter set of filters, for instance. Why allow NSFW images despite the risks and without any form of watermarking (which might soon be legally mandated in California) to prevent abuse? To the first question, Elle says that it would stifle “artistic freedom.” “We do allow mild artistic nudity and adult themes on the site when tagged as NSFW, but not outright porn. We’ve tried our best to ‘draw the line’ for our users in our community standards so that they understand what’s allowed and what’s not,” she added. “We pride ourselves on our community and being the ‘hub’ for all things AI art.” From my few searches, NightCafe doesn’t seem overrun with boundary-crossing objectionable stuff. But I couldn’t help but notice that most of the “sexy” images featured women — an unfortunate pattern on platforms such as these. Like many startups in the AI-powered art-generating space, NightCafe appears to be in a bit of a holding pattern. It’s bringing new models online, including video-generating models like Stable Video Diffusion . But it’s not rocking the boat too much — the unsaid reason being that a single court decision or regulation could force NightCafe to rethink its entire operation. Still, Elle seems to think NightCafe has legs and doesn’t need outside investment. “The majority of our competitors raised money over the last two years while image generation was hot,” Russell said. “Pretty much all of them were, or are, offering image generation at a loss to acquire users. Not all of them can succeed; NightCafe pioneered the intersection of AI and art but also championed the idea that creativity using advanced technology should be accessible for all.” There’s no plans for an enterprise NightCafe offering, despite how lucrative such a product could prove to be (moderation roadblocks aside). Elle says that the focus will remain on building a community and “social hub” atop the latest generative models. “One challenge that the industry faces is that image-generation models are getting so good, they’ll soon be commoditized,” she said. “What do companies compete on then? At NightCafe, we’ve chosen to focus on being an aggregator of the top models to provide the best variety and highest level of technology.” We’ll see how it navigates the choppy waters from here."},

He announced that the organization’s prestigious Grammy Awards would finally accept music made with artificial intelligence. At first, people were confused, and then Mason came out to clarify that he meant only humans can submit to the awards, but that AI can be used in the creative process. “It’s a bit of a fine line, but that’s going to evolve,” he told TechCrunch about how the Academy is assessing the use of artificial intelligence in music. “My hope is that we can continue to celebrate human creativity at the highest level.” The rise of AI has consumed the arts, just as it has Silicon Valley. Everyone is pondering: Will AI replace me? And within music — what happens to copyright? Royalties? To the hard work I’ve put into my craft? Mason said there are indeed concerns sweeping the industry. Some people are scared and nervous, while others are excited and optimistic. Some artists are sending cease-and-desist letters to get unauthorized deepfakes of themselves taken down, while others are embracing their AI versions — so long as they get paid. “I wholeheartedly believe that AI in music shouldn’t even exist,” musician Devante, the Artist told TechCrunch. “AI should really only be used for simple daily tasks. As an artist, the ‘AI is taking over the world’ take is very real these days. Music is my world and now it’s all too easy for someone to masquerade as something it’s taken my whole life to be.” “I think a lot of musicians, particularly the ones who haven’t ‘made it,’ are taking a glass-half-empty perspective on AI,” a musician who also works for a Big Tech company told TechCrunch. He asked to remain anonymous because he did not have permission from his employer to speak on the matter. “Just as the industrial revolution did not lead to widespread unemployment and in fact quite the opposite, more creatives, especially musicians, should flip their mindset and lean in.” AI is already being used in music, mostly in the process of mastering and equalizing sounds, Mason said. The biggest concerns right now in the industry are making sure people get the right approvals to use an artist’s work, making sure humans are credited separately from AI, and making sure people are getting paid fairly, whether that’s the copyright AI is trained on or the likeness of an artist. There’s also the issue of ensuring these protections across the industry. Mason co-launched the Human Artistry Campaign to address some of these issues and advocate for more guardrails around the use of AI. He was involved with the ELVIS Act, passed in Tennessee, which gives artists more protection over the unauthorized use of their voices. He’s also supporting the No AI Fraud Act and the No FAKES Act, which will protect creators’ likenesses from AI fakes. It’s a pressing matter that is moving faster than the law. This month, Donald Trump found himself in tricky legal water after using unauthorized AI images of Taylor Swift to help promote his presidential campaign. At the time, TechCrunch reported that the ELVIS Act is so new that there is no precedent on how it could be used to protect an artist like Swift in this situation. (Mason declined to comment on the matter then.) The push for more legislation within the music industry is quite interesting given the fact that the topic has caused much debate in Silicon Valley . Some AI purveyors in the U.S. favor a more laissez-faire attitude toward the technology in its early days and believe too many guardrails could hinder innovation. Others are looking at it from a societal standpoint, wanting protections against the impact that unchecked AI could have on people. Governments across the U.S. — and even on a national stage — are battling this out now. Devante, the Artist feels there is a disconnect between what is being done to regulate AI versus what should be done. He wants to see the development of AI slowed down or see innovation that can help protect music, such as a type of filter that can differentiate AI vocals from human ones. “As it comes to our industry and the creative community, there’s still a concern,” Mason said. “There’s uncertainty because there just doesn’t seem to be protections in place.” In 2020, when Mason first became president of the Recording Academy, AI was hardly a topic of discussion. Then, around 2023, everything started to change. A deepfake song featuring trained, unauthorized AI vocals on Drake and the Weeknd went viral. Fans loved it, and the person who created the song spoke of possibly entering the song into the Grammys. The Academy had to act fast, dealing with something it had never dealt with before. “That was the point at which we started having to pay close attention to it,” Mason said. The song was deemed ineligible for the Grammys and was taken down, but its legacy lived on. The highest profile AI situation since then ironically also involved Drake. During the Drake-Kendrick Lamar feud , Drake used unauthorized AI vocals of the late hip-hop icon Tupac in an attempted diss track against Lamar and was immediately threatened with a lawsuit by Tupac’s estate for using his likeness without permission. Meanwhile, producer Metro Boomin, who also has qualms with Drake, created an AI song called “BBL Drizzy,” which fans raved about, even after learning it was AI. Mason said consumers aren’t always going to know when something is AI — nor will they always go through the credits to find out. Mason said that many consumers don’t seem to care much about whether AI is used in music, another reason why protecting creators is so important. “I don’t think people care what they consume,” Devante, the Artist agreed. “It’s almost like a ‘not me, not my problem situation.’” At the same time, Mason believes that humans will just evolve to live with AI, just like they’ve adapted to nearly every other new form of technology. Years ago, artists had to learn how to use synthesizers or how to sample music. The latter especially posed a problem, as some artists would just sample another person’s music without permission. Eventually, the industry went back and figured out a standard way to allocate credit and royalties. “We’ll make great music with the new technology,” Mason said about AI. “But I just want to make sure it’s done in a way that’s fair to the human creators.” This story was updated to clarify the AI song of Drake and the Weeknd submitted to the Grammys."},

It’s also signed a non-exclusive license to use Covariant’s robotic foundation models. Earlier this year, Chen told TechCrunch that Covariant is building “a large language model, but for robot language.” In other words, it’s creating AI models for robots, with an initial focus on robotic arms performing common warehouse tasks like bin picking. “With some of the smartest minds, we will advance fundamental research, marrying our rich expertise to unlock new ways for AI and robots to assist our operations employees,” said Joseph Quinlivan, vice president of Amazon Fulfillment Technologies & Robotics, in a statement. “[Embedding] Covariant’s AI technology into our existing robot fleet will make them more performant and create real-world value for our customers.” The deal sounds similar to Amazon’s hiring of the founders of AI startup Adept back in June — another deal that gave Amazon access to new talent and technology without having to fully acquire an existing startup. At the time, The Verge described this approach as a “reverse acquihire,” where tech giants facing antitrust scrutiny can use hiring and licensing deals to disguise their acquisitions, rather than the other way around. Covariant, meanwhile, said it will continue operating under the leadership of Ted Stinson and Tianhao Zhang, with Stinson — who’d been the startup’s COO — now stepping into the CEO role. The company added that it remains “dedicated to delivering the Covariant Brain into production environments across a broad set of global industries, including apparel, health and beauty, grocery, and pharmaceuticals.”"},

No surprise there: South Korea has long been one of Asia’s strongest economies. Startups here have enjoyed good access to funding, benefiting from Big Tech companies like Google, Meta, Qualcomm and Samsung setting up operations locally, as well as from dedicated venture arms. It also helps that the Korean government has spurred investment by setting up innovation hubs, incubators and accelerators. Today, South Korea ranks ninth on the list of countries with the highest number of unicorns, per Statista, and its capital city, Seoul, is considered one of the top destinations to build a tech startup. But like elsewhere in the world, startups here have not been immune to economic turmoil — tech firms have been cutting costs and laying people off to make the most of a diminished funding environment, startup valuations have dipped, and growth-stage funding has proved hard to come by. Asian startups in general have struggled to raise capital since the market turned in early 2022, and in 2023, venture capital investments in South Korea dipped to around 5.4 trillion KRW ($4 billion) from 6.8 trillion KRW ($5.1 billion) a year earlier, according to Statista. It seems that 2024 will prove to be a pivotal year for many startups in the country, especially as some big names intend to go public either domestically or in the U.S. Here’s a list of the top startups to look out for: A travel booking platform founded in 2005 by Su-jin Lee , Yanolja is best known for revisiting and pivoting the concept behind love hotels in Korea — turning them from places known best for amorous assignations (rented for as little as one hour) into attractive short-term rental options for hip young people and travelers. Today, it has operations in more than 200 countries. The startup joined the unicorn club in June 2019 with a $180 million Series D round led by Singapore’s sovereign fund, GIC and Booking. And in 2021, SoftBank Vision Fund II invested about $1.7 billion in a Series E that valued the startup between $7 billion and $9 billion. Earlier this year, Yanolja set up a subsidiary in Manhattan, Yanolja US, to speed up its move toward a Nasdaq listing. Last December, the company hired A lexandre Ibrahim , who had a stint at the New York Stock Exchange, as its new chief financial officer. Yanolja is reportedly preparing to raise $400 million in its initial public offering in the U.S., which could value the company between $7 billion and $9 billion. However, Singaporean e-commerce platform Qoo10’s liquidity crisis has emerged as an important variable in Yanolja’s listing on the Nasdaq. Yanolja sold Interpark Commerce to Qoo10 in April 2023 and was promised to be paid $127.8 million in installments by 2026, but Yanolja has not yet received the remaining amount. Seung-gun Lee, a former dentist, founded Viva Republica in 2015, the company behind the finance super app Toss , because he was fed up with the complexity of South Korea’s online payment systems. Lee was apparently not the only one tired of jumping through hoops to make payments, and his app quickly took off. Three years later, Viva Republica hit unicorn status after raising $80 million. The company was last valued at about $7 billion (9.1 billion KRW) in December 2022 after a $405 million Series G round . Today, Toss has more than 19 million monthly active users. Earlier this year, Viva Republica hired advisers to go public next year in South Korea. It posted revenue of $994.1 million (1.37 trillion KRW) in 2023, and the company said it is likely to reach profitability this year . Kurly has harbored dreams of an IPO for years, but it may finally be able to resume its listing plan. Riding high on pandemic-driven tailwinds, the grocery delivery service initially planned to list in the U.S. in 2021 . But then it shelved those plans in favor of an IPO in Seoul in 2023. Those plans ended up getting shelved , too, after the IPO window failed to reopen fully in 2023. The company last year started diversifying its offerings, selling everything from high-end cosmetics to personal care products and supplements as it sought to bolster its revenue and gross merchandise volume ahead of its IPO. But an IPO may be on the cards soon: Kurly recorded its first profitable month in December 2023, marking a significant milestone since its establishment in 2015. The company has long expressed its intention to pursue a listing after becoming EBITDA-positive. Kurly was last valued at around $3.3 billion when it raised a $210 million pre-IPO round in December 2021, but reports suggest the company’s price tag has since shrunk to $669 million . Dunamu, the operator of Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange Upbit , started as a stock trading service in 2012 and launched a crypto exchange in 2017. And in 2021, it became the first company to acquire a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license in South Korea. Currently South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange operator, Dunamu briefly enjoyed a juicy valuation of about $17 billion in 2022, when the crypto industry was still riding high. But as the hype around crypto faded in 2023 following the collapse of Luna and FTX, the company’s value similarly plummeted to $2.2 billion . Dunamu saw an uptick in profit in the previous year, stemming from the recovery of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This resulted in a net profit of approximately $594 million in 2023, reflecting a 515.4% increase from the previous year. Nevertheless, the company has encountered obstacles in diversifying its revenue sources and managing losses within its subsidiaries. Dunamu is reportedly aiming to go public on the Nasdaq . Along with its Kakao’s fashion platform Zigzag, Korean retail giant Shinsegae’s W Concept, and Naver-backed Brandi, Seoul-based fashion marketplace Musinsa is one of the biggest and most popular fashion marketplaces in South Korea. It offers more than 8,000 local and foreign fashion brands spanning diverse categories, including casual, sports and luxury to 13 million users. The startup claims its annual GMV crossed $2.35 billion (3 trillion KRW) in 2022 and that its revenue hit $662.5 million in 2022. The company is reportedly in talks with investment banks to run its initial public offering in South Korea in 2025. Founded in 2012 by CEO Man-ho Cho, the Korean fashion platform raised a $190 million Series C round led by KKR that valued it at approximately $2.76 billion in July 2023. Founded in 2015 by Gary Kim and Paul Kim, Danggeun Market runs Karrot, the hyperlocal marketplace app for owned goods. The platform has operations in South Korea, Canada, the U.K., the U.S. and Japan, and raised $162 million in a Series D round at a valuation of $2.7 billion in 2021. The company posted its first profit in 2023 on the back of strong user growth in the U.S. and Canada. The company has since been expected to go public, but its CEO Gary Kim said in May that the company would consider an IPO after building a stronger financial base. Founded in 2016, Bucketplace ‘s home decorating and interior app OHouse started off simply as a community of people sharing interior design content. Today, the company is offering a variety of services that encompass almost everything involved in the residential space, ranging from home improvement, home repairs and maintenance to furniture delivery, moving services and even a garbage can pickup service. The company last raised a $182 million Series D round at a valuation of $1.4 billion in 2022 . It recently turned down an investment from China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to local media reports. Bucketplace’s business model is similar to Houzz, a California-based home remodeling software platform that’s preparing to go public as early as this year . Moloco , an adtech startup that uses machine learning tech to build mobile campaigns, serves mobile app developers in a wide range of industries, like gaming, social networking, e-commerce, ride-sharing, food delivery and fintech, helping them turn their first-party user data into marketing, monetization and user acquisition campaigns. The company was valued at more than $2 billion after EDBI, a Singapore-based private equity and venture capital arm of the Singapore Economic Development Board , acquired shares in the company from another investor. The company had last raised $150 million in a Series C round led by Tiger Global Management at a valuation of $1.5 billion in 2021. Moloco intends to pursue a public listing on the Nasdaq and is currently assessing the appropriate timing for its initial public offering, CEO Ikkjin Ahn said during a press conference in Seoul in December 2023. ZigBang, a South Korean proptech startup, raised approximately $77 million (100 billion KRW) in Series E funding at a valuation of about $1.8 billion (2.5 trillion KRW) as its pre-IPO investment from the Korea Development Bank, IMM Investment and Hana Securities in 2022. It acquired a smart home business from Samsung SDS in January 2022 before getting Series E funding to enter the smart home industry. The Seoul-based real estate platform has been in the red for three years in a row, which is in line with the state of the real estate market in the country. Founded in 2016, Korea Credit Data (KCD) is a Seoul-based fintech startup that offers an array of services for 2 million small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) merchants in Korea. KCD launched its flagship service, Cashnote, a bookkeeping app for SMEs, in 2017 to enable SME owners to track a comprehensive overview of cashflow, including revenues, credit card sales, expenditures, sales ledgers, and policy information. The startup raised $77 million (100 billion KRW) in funding at a valuation of approximately $1 billion (~1.3 trillion KRW) from investment funds managed by Morgan Stanley Tactical Value in August 2023. KCD is reportedly planning to go public in 2025."},

The microblogging platform announced late Friday that it was seeing “all-time-highs for activity” with 500,000 new users joining in the previous two days. It’s also number one on the free iPhone app chart in Brazil today, ranking just ahead of Meta’s Threads at number two. Noting the rankings, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber wrote , “good job Brazil, you made the right choice.” That growth is particularly impressive for a platform that only fully opened to the public in February and winkingly acknowledged its small size (especially compared to rivals X and Threads) by describing itself as “the short king of social apps.” The company says it had more than 6 million users as of May 2024. Bluesky was first announced in 2019 as a Twitter-backed initiative to build an open, decentralized social protocol. It has since become an independent public benefit corporation, with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey leaving the board earlier this year. Elon Musk’s X, meanwhile, has been engaged in an escalating legal fight with Brazil’s Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes over the company’s refusal to block certain accounts as part of a broader crackdown on what Moraes said is election disinformation.

He followed through on Friday , and also threatened fines against users who try to circumvent the ban by using a VPN.

Our exceptional legal team at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher stands ready to represent the company in seeking to enforce our rights vigorously.” Bolt, which offers tools for one-click e-commerce checkout, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Silverbear partner Veronica Welch told Forbes that “this never had anything to do with any miscommunications” and that the deal “was never discussed or approved in the company.” Earlier this month, a leaked term sheet showed that Bolt was aiming to raise $200 million in equity funding and $250 million in “marketing credits” at a $14 billion valuation, with an unusual pay-to-play deal structure that would essentially force existing backers to either invest or lose their stakes in the company. While Silverbear was initially reported to be leading the equity round, the firm’s partner Brad Pamnani recently told TechCrunch he’s actually putting the deal together through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) managed by a private equity fund based in the United Arab Emirates. “At the beginning, I used my Silverbear email to respond to some things and that caused some confusion but Silverbear was never actually looking at this deal,” Pamnani said. Meanwhile, the London Fund’s CEO confirmed in an interview with TechCrunch that the firm is contributing “marketing credits” to the deal. However, the London Fund released a statement Friday saying that it has not seen and cannot “confirm the validity of any part of a document leaked to the press.” “We can confirm that there have been discussions between The London Fund and Bolt’s management; however, at no point have we stated that a transaction has concluded,” the firm said."},

In addition, large mergers-and-acquisitions (M&A) deals have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly involving Big Tech or multi-billion-dollar conglomerates. Notably, a decline in venture investment within any startup ecosystem can often be linked to a lack of exit volume and value. In Africa, for instance, the number of M&A exits peaked at 44 in 2021, when the continent attracted nearly $6 billion in venture capital. However, in 2022, the number of exits dropped to 29, alongside a decrease in venture capital investment to over $3 billion. Despite these challenges, local investors remain optimistic, saying that M&A activity will eventually pick up as founders and investors seek liquidity in an increasingly tough market. “We will continue to see few exits (IPOs) in 2024, given that many companies scaled down growth to adjust to the reduction in capital availability. But we will likely see more consolidations and M&A activity as undercapitalized companies seek to benefit from the value they have created on a larger platform,” TLcom Capital partner Andreata Muforo told TechCrunch in an interview last year. Yet, the debate continues over whether the African tech ecosystem has lived up to expectations or underperformed regarding exit outcomes (M&As and IPOs) relative to the venture capital invested: over $20 billion. One perspective argues that the number of exits doesn’t justify the capital infusion, while another emphasizes that even a few landmark exits are commendable given the ecosystem’s relative youth. Expensya stands as one of Africa’s landmark exit stories, demonstrating the potential for significant returns even within a young and emerging tech ecosystem. Having raised slightly over $20 million, the Tunis- and Paris-based expense management startup was acquired by the private equity firm Medius, resulting in a cash-out of $10 million for its employees. The exit was valued at 1.5 times its last reported valuation of $83 million, according to PitchBook. This acquisition is particularly significant in the context of the African tech ecosystem, where the terms of M&A deals are often shrouded in secrecy. The lack of transparency around these transactions makes it challenging to gauge the true performance of the continent’s tech sector. However, when details are disclosed or found out, as in the case of Expensya, they provide valuable insights that help inform valuation and pricing strategies, allowing stakeholders to better align their expectations. As we continue to monitor the growth of Africa’s tech ecosystem, it’s essential to highlight and analyze the biggest disclosed acquisitions. These landmark exits, often disclosed, offer a clearer understanding of the continent’s progress and potential in delivering value through M&A activity. Founded by Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim in 2014, enterprise AI startup InstaDeep uses advanced machine learning techniques to bring AI to applications within an enterprise environment. The Tunis- and Paris-based startup raised over $108 million from investors, including BioNTech, Alpha Intelligence Capital, Endeavor Catalyst and Google. Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk founded Sendwave in 2014 to offer money transfer services from countries in North America and Europe to those in emerging markets: Africa, Asia , and the Americas. The YC-backed Sendwave raised over $15 million from Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Serena Ventures, and Partech. MainOne is a data center and connectivity solutions provider serving clients from technology enterprises to cloud service providers across West Africa, particularly Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. Founded by Funke Opeke in 2010, the Lagos-based Equinix subsidiary raised over $200 million in equity and debt before its acquisition. Eran Feinstein founded the payment gateway DPO Group in 2006. The Nairobi and Cape Town-based fintech provides payment services to thousands of merchants across multiple African countries. It raised over $15 million from Apis Partners and other investors. Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi launched Lagos-based Paystack in 2015 as a payment processing platform for African merchants to accept online payments via debit card and direct bank transfer. The YC-backed startup — arguably the first from the continent to graduate from the accelerator — raised over $12 million from Stripe, Visa, Tencent and Ingressive Capital. Acquirer: Stripe (2020) Exit: $200 million+ cash-and-stock. Expensya , founded by Karim Jouini and Jihed Othmani, provides smart payment card solutions to automate spend management for businesses across Europe. The Tunis-based software company raised $25 million from Bpifrance, ISAI and Silicon Badia. The Cape Town-based Fundamo was a platform that delivered mobile financial services, including person-to-person payments, airtime top-up, bill payment, and branchless banking services, to unbanked and underbanked consumers. The fintech, founded by Hannes van Rensburg in 2000, raised $5 million from South African investors, including Knife Capital. Bruce, Clyde, Warren van Wyk and George Karageorgiades founded Mauritius-based PaySpace in 2007 as a cloud-based payroll and HR platform to streamline payroll runs and backup procedures. The bootstrapped startup raised undisclosed venture for the first time last year from local payments solutions provider Netcash before its acquisition."},

The first episode, titled “Rosey the Robot,” was an origin story of sorts for the titular character, describing how an overworked Jane hired the housekeeper. Sixty-two years after her debut, Rosey remains an important pop cultural touchstone for the unfulfilled promise of home robots. The home of 2024 isn’t necessarily wholly devoid of robots. According to its own figures, iRobot has sold more than 50 million Roombas . That, meanwhile, is a fraction of the overall number of robot vacuums that have been sold around the globe. Robot lawnmowers and pool cleaners have gained traction as well, though those figures pale in comparison to their vacuuming counterparts. Home robots’ unfulfilled potential isn’t because of a lack of consumer demand or lack of effort from manufacturers. It’s more complicated and nuanced than that, though ultimately it’s a matter of pricing, functionality and efficacy. Outside of the aforementioned use cases, today’s home robots don’t do enough or do what they do well enough, and building a robot that can tick both of those boxes would prove prohibitively expensive for those of us who can’t afford our own islands. During his long tenure as iRobot CEO, co-founder Colin Angle was fond of saying that he didn’t become a successful roboticist until he became a vacuum salesman. It’s a fun quip that gets to something much deeper about the industry. Before the Roomba came along, the company had experimented with everything from baby dolls to military equipment. iRobot found success when it focused on a simple task: cleaning floors. The earliest models were primitive by today’s standards, but they got the job done well enough to justify their price point. In addition to marking 62 years since Rosey’s TV debut, next month is also the Roomba’s 22nd anniversary. The robot vacuum is old enough to legally buy a case of Sam Adams . In the nearly quarter century since the Roomba launched, much of iRobot’s R&D has gone into making the system smarter, adding sensing, mapping, and AI and integrating with smart assistants. The company has invested into other robotics categories as well, including gutter clearing, pool cleaning and a lawnmower that may never see the light of day, but all have failed to recapture the Roomba’s magic. Years ago, I appeared on a panel to discuss robots. The moment the conversation ended and the Q&A began, a woman’s hand shot up, front and center. She was eager to tell me about her billion-dollar idea: a drone that vacuums, dusts surfaces and does the laundry. I told her it was a great idea and I would happily buy one from her when she got it up and running. Everything in robotics is easier said than done. It isn’t that no one before her came up with the concept for a furniture-dusting drone; it’s that no one before her figured out how to build a reliable and robust version at scale with a price tag that isn’t higher than my 30-year mortgage. I thought back to that moment when Tesla announced its robot by way of a dancer in a spandex onesie . Elon Musk described a humanoid that would toil away all day at the factory and then pick up your groceries on the way home, before preparing your dinner. Musk has been in the public eye long enough to know precisely how much stock one should put in his timelines. Before the fully functioning Roseys of the world arrive, simpler machines are going to have to pave the way. Robots have had a place in manufacturing for decades, but they’ve been built to do one job well over and over again. The more complex the machine, the more expensive it gets and the more potential points of failure emerge. Think about how many ways your Roomba has failed and multiply that by the complexity of a humanoid. Most experts agree that early home robots will be designed for a handful of simple tasks: social robots and those providing caregiving and doing housework. For the foreseeable future, each will be designed with one or two functions in mind. There’s a sense of frustration that home systems are nowhere near where expected by this point in time. What regularly gets lost in that conversation, however, is the amount of groundwork that has already been laid. Whoever builds the next great home robot won’t have done so in a vacuum. Their success will be built not only on top of ongoing research, but also on the home robots that came before. Navigating in an environment as unstructured and dynamic as the home likely felt impossible for many before the first Roomba arrived. Again, it was a simple machine by today’s standards, but it laid the foundation for what comes next. One can see reflections of this in the current crop of home robots. Take Hello Robot . As design goes, it’s an extremely simplistic machine. It’s an arm attached to a pole attached to a Roomba-like base. Its simplicity is, in part, because it’s more development platform than product. But systems like this or, say, Matic’s robot vacuum , are continuing the hard work of building foundations, be they mapping, manipulation or navigation. Social home robots had a rough year in 2019. Anki, Kuri and Jino all fell in quick succession, each for a combination of price, limited functionality and reliability. More recently, Amazon’s Astro has been dead in the water , effectively kneecapped after Amazon’s belt tightening wiped out a significant portion of the company’s consumer hardware headcount. Of course, had the $1,600 robot been a wild success, the retail giant almost certainly wouldn’t have let it die a quiet death. Amazon’s struggles are a friendly reminder that being one of the world’s largest companies doesn’t guarantee success in such a treacherous category. And following the Vision Pro’s lukewarm reception, one has to wonder whether Apple might be walking a similar road with its reported home robot play . A more recent report suggested that the first project out of the group could look less like Amazon’s Astro and more like its Echo Show 10. The potential product has been described as something along the lines of an iPad-like tablet mounted to an arm. These are reports of nascent projects, which could go any number of ways, but as it stands, this sounds more in line with where the company’s robotic ambitions ought to be. Home robots are coming, but when they arrive, they’ll still have a long way to go. That said, Jane won’t bring home Rosey until 2062, so we’ve got time. Update: Amazon tells TechCrunch that reports of Astro’s demise have been greatly exaggerated. The company notes that the robot is still available through its Day One program and “Amazon is still fully committed to our vision of bringing world-class consumer robotics solutions to the home and excited about the in-home experiences we’re inventing for Astro.”"},

It’s an area called “emotion AI,” according to PitchBook’s new Enterprise Saas Emerging Tech Research report that predicts this tech is on the rise. The reasoning goes something like this: If businesses deploy AI assistants to execs and employees, make AI chatbots be front-line salespeople and customer service reps, how can an AI perform well if it doesn’t understand the difference between an angry “What do you mean by that?” and a confused “What do you mean by that?” Emotion AI claims to be the more sophisticated sibling of sentiment analysis, the pre-AI tech that attempts to distill human emotion from text-based interactions, particularly on social media. Emotion AI is what you might call multimodal, employing sensors for visual, audio, and other inputs combined with machine learning and psychology to attempt to detect human emotion during an interaction. Major AI cloud providers offer services that give developers access to emotion AI capabilities such as Microsoft Azure cognitive services’ Emotion API or Amazon Web Services’ Rekognition service. (The latter has had its share of controversy over the years.) While emotion AI, even offered as a cloud service, isn’t new, the sudden rise of bots in the workforce give it more of a future in the business world than it ever had before, according to PitchBook. “With the proliferation of AI assistants and fully automated human-machine interactions, emotion AI promises to enable more human-like interpretations and responses,” writes PitchBook’s Derek Hernandez, senior analyst, emerging technology in the report. “Cameras and microphones are integral parts of the hardware side of emotion AI. These can be on a laptop, phone, or individually located in a physical space. Additionally, wearable hardware will likely provide another avenue to employ emotion AI beyond these devices,” Hernandez tells TechCrunch. (So if that customer service chatbot asks for camera access, this may be why.) To that end, a growing cadre of startups are being launched to make it so. This includes Uniphore (with $610 million total raised , including $400 million in 2022 led by NEA), as well as MorphCast, Voicesense, Superceed, Siena AI, audEERING, and Opsis, each of which also raised modest sums from various VCs, PitchBook estimates. Of course, emotion AI is a very Silicon Valley approach: Use technology to solve a problem caused by using technology with humans. But even if most AI bots will eventually gain some form of automated empathy, that doesn’t mean this solution will really work. In fact, the last time emotion AI became of hot interest in Silicon Valley — around the 2019 time frame when much of the AI/ML world was still focused on computer vision rather than on generative language and art — researchers threw a wrench in the idea. That year, a team of researchers published a meta-review of studies and concluded that human emotion cannot actually be determined by facial movements. In other words, this idea that we can teach an AI to detect a human’s feelings by having it mimic how other humans try to do so (reading faces, body language, tone of voice) is somewhat misguided in its assumption. There’s also the possibility that AI regulation, such as the European Union’s AI Act, which bans computer-vision emotion detection systems for certain uses like education, may nip this idea in the bud. (Some state laws, like Illinois’ BIPA, also prohibit biometric readings from being collected without permission.) All of which gives a broader glimpse into this AI-everywhere future that Silicon Valley is currently madly building. Either these AI bots are going to attempt emotional understanding in order to do jobs like customer service, sales and HR and all the other tasks humans hope to assign them, or maybe they won’t be very good at any task that really requires that capability. Maybe what we’re looking at is an office life filled with AI bots on the level of Siri circa 2023. Compared with a management-required bot guessing at everyone’s feelings in real time during meetings, who’s to say which is worse?"},

The new feature is rolling out to users in the U.S. With the new tool, you can tailor your For You feed to show you more or less of certain topics. You can access the feature by going into your Settings, selecting “Content Preferences” and then clicking the “Manage Topics” option. From there, you can customize your preferences for different topics, such as sports, travel, humor, current affairs, dance, and food. You can do so by moving the slider to adjust how much you do or don’t want to see that sort of content in your For You feed. If you are uncertain about which type of videos fall under a category, you can click the “information” button next to a topic. For instance, TikTok says the “Creative arts” topic includes “painting, drawing, graphic design, and art-related tutorials.” TikTok says these selections will help the app either show more or less of a topic in your For You feed. Of course, this doesn’t impact the content you see from accounts you follow. The company notes that it may take some time for the app to personalize your feed based on your selections, so don’t expect the customization to be applied instantly. Although TikTok introduced a feature last year that allowed you to refresh your For You feed to retrain the app’s algorithm about the content you enjoy, this new feature lets you take a more focused approach to customizing what you see on the platform instead of just starting over fresh. And, while you can individually hold down on a video to click the “not interested” button to signal to the algorithm that you don’t want to see a certain type of video, you can now go directly into your settings and tell the app you don’t want to see that sort of content on your For You feed. It’s worth noting that although you can already select keywords and hashtags to filter out content from your For You feed, this new feature gets rid of having to manually enter a bunch of things you don’t want to see."},

Uber chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi outlined the plans in a press conference in Seoul, where he also kicked off a campaign to grow the company’s pool of drivers in the country. That will need to be a major effort. Currently Korea’s ride-hailing industry is dominated by Kakao Taxi, Kakao Mobility’s consumer service, with more than 23 million registered users and a 98% market share, per Statista . Khosrowshahi also added that Uber plans to expand its partnerships with Korean car technology companies, just as it has done in other markets. It’s been especially active on that front recently. Last week, Cruise, General Motors’s self-driving subsidiary, signed a multi-year partnership with Uber to bring its robotaxis to the ride-hailing platform in 2025. Uber announced this week it had made a strategic investment in Wayve, a U.K.-based startup that develops software for autonomous driving. Uber already works with Korea’s Hyundai in other markets like Europe . Uber ramping up in South Korea is the latest chapter in the drama that is the country’s ride-hailing market. Although Uber has gained notoriety around the world for how it has head-butted with regulators, in South Korea, more recently it has been the home-grown dominant player that has had that dubious honor. The country’s antitrust watchdog Fair Trade Commission fined Kakao Mobility $20 million for manipulating its algorithms to favor its own taxi franchise in February 2023. However, it did not file a complaint with the prosecution then. But in December last year, South Korean authorities asked the antitrust regulator to file a complaint against Kakao Mobility for algorithm manipulation favoring its own cabs, a repeat of the issue in February 2023. (For background, the Kakao app lets both franchise and non-franchise taxis pick up ride requests. Even if non-franchise taxis are closer, franchise taxis can still receive requests from clients.) Uber has not escaped controversy in the country. Uber opened for business in South Korea a decade ago, and soon after that, taxi drivers began to organize protests over what they saw as a threat to their livelihood. Seoul city authorities eventually announced it would ban the service in late 2013. It began those steps months later — although Uber did not completely exit the market. In 2020, it set up a joint venture with TMAP Mobility , a ride-hailing unit of local carrier SK Telecom, to make a comeback in the country. The following year, the JV company, called UT, launched its taxi-hailing service. Then, while still remaining a JV, that rebranded as Uber Taxi this March. As a minor player with likely less than 10% of the market when you count up other hopefuls, Uber has found itself the underdog in the country, but growth is coming at a fast clip at the moment. Uber this week said the number of passengers increased by almost 80% in the first half of 2024, compared to the same period last year. Since the rebranding, there has also been a double increase in usage from international travelers."},

From a scientific perspective, ridding those industries of fossil fuels is possible; economically, it’s not. Or at least not yet, claims a young startup. Oxylus Energy thinks it has the key to one part of the equation. The company was spun out of a Yale chemistry lab last year, and it has been working to refine the production of so-called green methanol. Today, most methanol is derived from fossil fuels and used to make petrochemicals, though it can also be used as a transportation fuel. Because of that flexibility, green methanol, which is made without fossil fuels, could rid carbon pollution from a range of industries. “We think it’s one of the most versatile chemicals that can really decarbonize the hard-to-abate sectors of shipping, aviation and petrochemicals that are responsible for 11% of emissions right now,” co-founder and COO Harrison Meyer told TechCrunch. While EVs have made inroads into consumer transportation and trucking, flying and heavy shipping are utterly dependent on energy-dense fossil fuels to make long-distance journeys. Batteries are too heavy, and switching everything over to green hydrogen would require costly retrofits of airplanes and ships. Motorsports fans will note that methanol has been used as a race fuel for decades, and many of today’s internal combustion engines can burn the stuff with only minor modifications. Some ocean-going ships have also made the switch , and while a barrel of methanol doesn’t hold as much energy as other maritime fuels like diesel, it’s close enough that the industry is giving it serious consideration. The hurdle for airlines is a bit higher because they would need green methanol refined into something that more closely resembles today’s jet fuel, which would raise the price. But the CO 2 savings only pencil out if the methanol itself is made in a low-carbon fashion. That’s where Oxylus comes in. Making green methanol is expensive today because making it is a multi-part process, and each energy-intensive step is carried out using costly equipment. Just one of those steps, sourcing green hydrogen, represents about 16% of the total cost, according to Lux Research . Oxylus Energy’s technology bypasses the need for green hydrogen by using a cobalt-based catalyst to facilitate the chemical reaction needed to produce methanol. The catalyst sits inside an electrolyzer, which uses electricity to split water and carbon dioxide molecules. Once the hydrogen, oxygen and carbon atoms are separate, they combine to form methanol (CH 3 OH) and oxygen (O 2 ). All of this happens at standard room temperature and pressure, helping to keep costs down. “As is the case in CO 2 electrolysis, you’re always fighting making hydrogen,” CTO Conor Rooney said. If too many hydrogen atoms combine into hydrogen molecules (H 2 ), then there aren’t enough left over to produce methanol. The chemical structure of Oxylus’ catalyst helps steer the reaction in the right direction, allowing methanol to form after hydrogen is liberated from water. “You need to have this beautiful balance,” Rooney said. The methanol Oxylus produces can be used by the chemical industry to make a range of widely used chemicals, including formaldehyde and acetic acid. With some additional processing and refining, it can be turned into sustainable aviation fuel. The startup exclusively told TechCrunch that it recently raised a $4.5 million seed round led by Toyota Ventures and Azolla Ventures with participation from Earth Foundry and Connecticut Innovations. The funding will go toward building a production-scale reactor which the company hopes will help prove its aggressive price targets. “At renewable energy prices that you can contract at today, we’ll be at or below cost parity with fossil methanol,” CEO Perry Bakas said. “The core question is, can we build a system in the next few years? That’s really a time and money problem, which is what we’re really focusing on.”"},

The wealth and asset manager disclosed in a June update to its investors that it values VerSe at $2.9 billion, according to an internal document reviewed by TechCrunch. 360 One owns a 2% stake in the startup. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup — which counts Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, CPP Investments, Goldman Sachs, Google, Sofina and Peak XV among its other backers — was valued at about $5 billion in a $805 million funding round it announced in April 2022. In the update, 360 One also disclosed that it had marked up the valuation of NSE , India’s largest exchange, to $29.9 billion, TechCrunch previously reported. 360 One declined to comment. “Ever since our last round in April 2022, our business has grown exponentially wherein revenue has grown more than 2x and burn has reduced by more than 3x. Hence while the company has not engaged in a price discovery round since then, the exponential growth of every single financial metric in the business, highlights that our valuation would only have grown since 2022,” a VerSe spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Different investors come in at different points of time at differential price points and can opt to mark their value accordingly. However the actions of a very small minority investor, in no way apply to 98% of the investors on the cap table who has still marked the primary value of the company at its last round post valuation of ~ $5Bn.The company is very well capitalized & has not raised any capital since April 2022 & we would like to categorically highlight that there is no change in the valuation of the company as reflected in our filings as well.” This downward valuation adjustment aligns with an ongoing global trend: Investors are marking down the worth of their startup holdings. For instance, asset manager Fidelity has reduced the value of its stakes in X , Gupshup and Discord . Fidelity disclosed on Friday that it values its holding in X, formerly Twitter, at approximately 27.94% of its original investment. This new valuation places the Elon Musk-led social media company, which he bought for $44 billion, at $12.3 billion at the end of July. Similarly, Fidelity estimates that SaaS startup Gupshup is now worth about $541 million, down from its $1.4 billion valuation in 2021. The investor update from 360 One also covered holdings in several other startups. It valued food delivery giant Swiggy at $11.5 billion, up from its last private funding round in early 2022 at $10.7 billion. The report assigned a $4 billion valuation to Pine Labs, a merchant payments platform. Online meat and seafood retailer Licious was valued at $900 million, while edtech company upGrad had a valuation of $1.9 billion ascribed to it, TechCrunch previously reported ."},

Traditionally, video game NPCs are directed by predetermined scripts, which can feel repetitive, unrealistic and boring. It also may restrict the number of potential experiences for players. However, when generative AI is involved, players can engage in casual conversation and interact with NPCs how they want to (within reason). Founded by gaming veterans from Riot Games, Wizards of the Coast and Magic: The Gathering, the company announced on Friday its first game that will leverage generative AI tools to help with gameplay mechanics, content generation, dialogue and item generation. Jam & Tea’s debut game, Retail Mage, is a roleplaying game that allows players to take on the role of a wizard working as a salesperson at a magical furniture store. The main goal of the game is to earn five-star reviews by helping customers. But it’s really up to the players to decide if they actually want to work or cause chaos. With AI NPCs as customers and human players being able to say and do almost whatever they want, the possible outcomes should vary widely. In Retail Mage, players are approached by customers who each have their own requests. Instead of selecting from preset phrases, players can type in the text generator how they’d like to respond. The player can ask the AI to “say something charming,” and it will offer four different dialogue options. Jam & Tea is among several companies competing in the AI-powered NPC space, alongside Artificial Agency , Inworld and Nvidia . Ubisoft’s AI-powered “Ghostwriter” tool writes NPC dialogue for some of its games. The new game also comes at a time when there’s concern among creatives about the potential challenges posed by the prevalence of generative AI. Last month, SAG-AFTRA — the union comprised of voice actors and other talent — initiated a strike against major game publishers over AI concerns. However, Jam & Tea claims it’s taking a balanced approach to the inclusion of AI, and wants to protect artists, writers and other creatives working in game design. “Our philosophy is that we believe creatives are going to be only more essential as we move forward in using this technology and in bringing new experiences to players,” co-founder and chief creative officer M. Yichao , who was the former narrative designer for Guild Wars 2, League of Legends and other titles, told TechCrunch. “AI will generate all this dialogue, and you can talk to characters endlessly… but it’s going to take the creative eye and lens to really add meaning to that and to craft that into an experience that matters into something with impact, depth and emotion that carries through stories. That’s going to become more important than ever,” Yichao added. He explained that creatives are heavily involved throughout the development process, including when it comes to crafting NPCs, giving them motivation, interests and backstory, as well as providing example lines to help the AI mimic the tone and generate lines in real-time. Despite its advantages, generative AI in NPCs has its limitations. One major concern is the issue of AI unpredictability, when the behavior of an NPC becomes excessively erratic, resulting in a frustrating experience for the player. AI can also hallucinate answers, so there’s a possibility that the NPC could say something that’s wrong or doesn’t exist in the world. Continuously improving the AI engine will help mitigate unpredictable NPCs, Yichao believes. Players can also rate the characters’ responses, which provides data to help improve the characters’ behavior. Plus, Jam & Tea claims to have put guardrails in place to prevent inappropriate conversations. Players are still encouraged to be creative, allowing for inventive and spontaneous interactions to occur. For example, instead of helping a customer, players can choose to engage in activities instead, like playing hide and seek — a real scenario that occurred during playtesting. “Our lead engineer was playtesting one night and went up to the NPCs and just said, ‘I’m bored.’ And the NPC responded by saying, ‘Well, why don’t we play a game? Let’s play hide and seek.’ And so the other NPCs heard and said, ‘Oh, we’re playing too,’” shared co-founder and CTO Aaron Farr . The NPCs proceeded to follow the rules of the game, with one seeker walking throughout the store to find all the hiders. “None of that was programmed; all of that was emergent behavior. That is part of the delight of when we have what a player wants to do combined with its experience to modify the experience in real-time,” added Farr, a former engineering leader at Riot Games and Singularity 6. The company has been experimenting with various large language models (LLMs) throughout the testing phase, including OpenAI, Google’s Gemma, Mistral AI and Meta’s Llama, and other open models. It’s currently uncertain which LLM it will ultimately use in the final version of the game, but is fine-tuning the model to train it on how to give better responses that are more “in character.” Jam & Tea’s AI engine goes beyond dialogue generation. Players can also interact with any object in the game and state their intentions with that object, such as picking it up or dismantling it for parts. They can even create items from scratch. Depending on what they want to do, the game interprets that intention and determines if they’re successful or not. In a demo shown to TechCrunch, Yichao interacted with an NPC named Noreen, who asked for an antelope-shaped plush. He then typed a command into an action box and retrieved a pillow resembling an antelope from a crate. The game recognized his action as successful and added the item to his inventory. Because the item didn’t previously exist in the game, players won’t physically see an antelope-shaped plush appear. All that happens in the game is the item shows up in the player’s inventory as a default image of a pillow. If the player wants to perform an action, like sitting in a chair, a notification appears on the screen indicating that the action was performed. “One of the things that’s really exciting about this technology is it allows for open-ended creative expression. Like, I can take a piece of meat and say, what if I put it in the bowl and I make a delicious fish stew? We might not have a fish stew [image], but one of the things that I’m working with our artists on is coming up with a creative ability to represent that item in a way that’s satisfying in the world and allows the player’s imagination to fill in some of those blanks, and gives players maximum creative freedom to make things that are unexpected,” Yichao said. AI technology won’t be used for 2D or 3D asset generation. Real artists will create the images. Retail Mage is a relatively basic game compared to others. At launch, the company promises to provide a more advanced product than the test version we saw during the demo. Jam & Tea states that the game is primarily intended to demonstrate the application of the technology as it continues to experiment. Beyond Retail Mage, the company is also developing another game — currently referred to as “Project Emily” internally — which will showcase their broader ambitions, featuring more environments and a sophisticated storyline. The startup’s scrappy team of eight has a lot of work ahead to reach the level of bigger gaming companies. However, taking action now while there is momentum allows the company to adapt and grow as AI models advance. Jam & Tea raised $3.15 million in seed funding from London Venture Partners with participation from Sisu Game Ventures and 1Up Ventures. It plans to raise another round later this year. As for the business model, Jam & Tea will charge $15 to buy the game and offer extra game packs that players can purchase separately. It’ll launch on PCs initially, but the company aims to enable cross-platform functionality within the next few years. Retail Mage is slated to be released to the public later this fall."},

A few months ago, companies like Humane and Rabbit launched their own gadgets powered by generative AI. It’s probably too early to fully write off any of those companies or products, but Humane’s Ai Pin, in particular, faced scathing reviews. And more broadly, none of these devices have been enough of a hit to prove that this is going to be a new category that most consumers actually care about. So in that context, the fact that Plaud’s NotePin is focused only on note-taking may be a disappointment, or it might make the company’s promises seem more believable. You can wear it as a necklace or a wristband, allowing you to record meetings and dictate notes to yourself, and those recordings are then transcribed using OpenAI’s GPT-4o. On today’s TechCrunch Minute, we talk about the promise of AI pins, the vision for Plaud’s NotePin and the company’s other products."},
{"category": "Apps", "title": "Hello Wonder is building an AI-powered browser for kids", "date": "2024-08-30", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/30/hello-wonder-is-building-an-ai-powered-browser-for-kids/", "content": "Across the world, regulators have ramped up their efforts to try and increase the safety of kids on the internet. Major social networks are facing scrutiny, and as a countermeasure, trying to roll out tools to protect kids. The core issue in the focus is the content that shows up on children’s screens and how to make it safe. While a lot of these efforts are geared toward teens, toddlers also use devices to consume content. So, a trio of founders who have worked at companies like Google and Amazon are trying to create an AI-powered browser/companion to create a safe environment for kids to learn and explore through Hello Wonder . The company currently has an iPad app — which parents have full control over — that lets kids ask questions to an AI chatbot and get answers, videos and interactive experiences that are safe for them. The startup believes that current content tools like YouTube Kids are focused on more engagement and don’t give parents enough insights about what their kids are consuming. That’s the problem the company has set out to solve. Hello Wonder has raised $2.1 million from investors such as Designer Fund, a16z Scout Fund, Ground Up Ventures and Chasing Rainbows. Investors also include individuals like kids’ content studio PocketWatch’s CEO Chris Williams, Things, Inc. founder Jason Toff and electronics-focused fund MESH’s CEO Tony Fai. Hello Wonder was founded by Seth Raphael, who led AI prototyping teams at Google and helped built the first version of Google Photos; Brian Backus, who worked as a games producer at Amazon, Disney, DreamWorks and NBCUniversal; and Daniel Shiplacoff, a product designer who worked on Google’s Material Design guidelines. Raphael built the app out of necessity while raising five children under 12 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He told TechCrunch that while he had seen the potential for AI to help children while studying at university, the technology wasn’t ripe. “The fundamental problem is that you and I use the internet wonderfully every single day and get tremendous value out of it. But we can’t let our kids do that because there is real harm. Plus, young kids don’t have the ability or tools to find out the content that’s helpful to them,” he said. Raphael said that he began by trying to find the best content for his children. But that was constraining when kids wanted to explore a certain topic more. Then, he took inspiration from the Montessori method of learning, which involves hands-on learning and activities based on children’s interests. That led the company to build an AI-powered environment to bring content from different corners of the internet in a safe manner. The company lets parents control what kind of content — videos, games and material from websites — their children are consuming. They can get texts about all kinds of videos or choose to get a daily or weekly summary of their consumption. Parents and guardians can tell the AI through the parent interface in natural language about the content they want and don’t want their children to consume. For instance, if a family wants to help their kid learn violin, they can tell Hello Wonder that, and the tool will find and insert content about learning violin from time to time. Hello Wonder, which targets kids from ages five to 10, also lets them interact with trusted family contacts through messages and video calls within the app. Jordan Odinsky, a partner at Ground Up Ventures, said that Hello Wonder solves the problem of kids having to see unsafe content by involving an AI and having it scan content for safety before serving it to kids. “Safety systems on today’s apps services for children don’t go far enough. As a browser, Hello Wonder doesn’t lock kids into any one format. They’re free to explore with the AI watching over them. They can consume any type of content as long as it fits within the parent’s values giving them a true internet experience,” he told TechCrunch over a call. Odinsky added that the app could also be adopted as the child matures and show content to reflect that growth. He said that the app doesn’t have a problem presenting children with a blank search box and leaving them clues about what they want to ask. “Wonder is built differently. When kids log on, they are prompted each time with ideas to search for. From there, it sparks new ideas to explore that you simply input by speaking. Many of the things browsers deal with, from exploration to discovery to figuring out the best prompt to achieve a desired result, are removed from the Wonder experience,” he noted. The company is not charging a fee for the app at this time but will introduce a subscription layer in the future. It is also testing to expand the app to Android tablets and Chromebooks."},

Although the company already previously announced that it would restrict Gemini queries related to the election, it’s now applying additional restrictions to its other generative AI products. These safeguards will be applied to Search AI Overviews, YouTube AI-generated summaries for Live Chat , Gems and image generation in Gemini. As part of the restrictions, these AI products will not respond to election-related topics. Given that generative AI is a relatively newer technology, Google acknowledges that it’s prone to making mistakes, which is why it’s restricting the features to prevent misinformation around the election. “Particularly for federal and state-wide elections, our users depend on us to provide reliable and up-to-date information on topics like current candidates, voting processes, and election results — and this new technology can make mistakes as it learns or as news breaks,” Google’s vice president of trust and safety, Laurie Richardson, wrote in a blog post. Misinformation was a significant issue during the 2020 presidential election , but with the rise of generative AI, misinformation during the 2024 election is poised to be even more of a problem. With the changes announced on Friday, Google is trying to get ahead of the problem. The company also announced that as with past elections, Google Search is getting a feature that will help people across the country find information about registering to vote. In addition, users will start to see new features on YouTube that will help them find credible information about election candidates and their political parties. As the election nears, the video platform will start to display reminders on where and how to vote. To help people find reliable election information, Google Play has launched a new badge that will be displayed on apps from official government agencies."},

Want it in your inbox every Friday? Sign up here . This week was a bit of a carryover from the one before as Bolt’s drama keeps unfolding — another story to be continued. But capital also flew to startups with traction, VC funds with track records, and worthy theses. Some stories emerge and die in a matter of days. Others require us to stay tuned for more, and this week brought us several of these. Bolt soap : It’s no overstatement to say that the fallout after Bolt’s letter to investors has been wild . The $14 billion valuation the fintech startup said it was seeking seemed as shocking as the terms of the potential deal. Now one of its proposed new backers, The London Fund, has been found to be scrubbing its web page , and the saga is likely not over. Board pressure : Ailing startup Fluid Truck, a Zipcar for commercial trucks, saw its board oust its sibling co-founders amid allegations of mismanaging funds, sources said. The leadership shake-up follows several rounds of layoffs and other cost-cutting measures, which clearly weren’t the end of the story. Food squared : Only a few weeks after GrubMarket acquired Good Eggs for an undisclosed sum, the $3.6 billion food delivery and supply chain startup made another acquisition. This time, its target was FreshGoGo , a New York-based B2C platform selling Asian groceries and ready-made dishes. The companies didn’t disclose the terms of the deal, which may not be the last as the food delivery space keeps on consolidating. Exec shuffles : AI expert Andrew Ng stepped down as CEO of Landing AI , the computer vision company he co-founded, which will now be headed by ex-COO Dan Maloney. As for Ng, he transitioned to an executive chairman role, but we also expect to hear more news from his AI Fund soon. Open wallet : OpenAI is reportedly in talks to close a new funding round led by previous backer Thrive Capital at a valuation of more than $100 billion . Once again, stay tuned. At the risk of stating the obvious, fundraising is a lot easier when you have traction, and news this week confirmed this. Enterprise resource planning : Opkey, an AI-based ERP testing platform, has closed a $47 million Series B round of funding . ERP apps are a large source of IT spend for big organizations, which makes automated testing valuable. This helped the company secure 200 large enterprise customers and partnerships with system integrators like KPMG and PwC. Skills for bills : With cloud spending another top concern for businesses, nOps raised a $30 million Series A to help companies optimize their AWS bill. The company also said that its customer base grew 450% over the past 18 months. Fast money : Comun, a neobank focused on serving Latino immigrants in the United States, has raised a $21.5 million Series A less than nine months after its previous round thanks to its traction: It reported growing monthly revenue by “50x” in the first six months of 2024. Its founders plan to use the capital to grow the team in order to scale and launch new products. Big fish : Canadian AI startup Viggle raised a $19 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Two Small Fish. The company is responsible for JST-1, a 3D-video foundation model it trained on YouTube videos, which lets users control animated characters, inspiring many memes. Swiss-made : Helped by its track record, Redalpine, a science-heavy European VC firm created in 2006, raised $200 million for its seventh early-stage fund . With offices in Zurich and Berlin, it also plans to open one in London, partly due to its interest in university spinouts. Improving cancer care : With $30 million in committed capital , Oncology Ventures is a new VC firm that will join the ranks of other cancer-focused VC firms — but with a focus on startups that improve patient care. It is led by Ben Freeberg, a solo GP and cancer survivor. ICYMI : Being a solo GP or even a small VC fund is hard, but the SEC just made life a little easier for emerging funds . The dollar threshold for a vehicle to be considered a “qualifying venture fund” and benefit from corresponding exemptions is now $12 million, up from $10 million. The secondaries market is hot , fueled in big part by an appetite for shares in hot AI companies , and the last few days have brought us more proof. An SEC filing revealed that New Enterprise Associates (NEA) reentered the space by raising more than $468 million for NEA Secondary Opportunity Fund , yet another fund dedicated to the buying of secondary shares. Meanwhile, it emerged that Paris-based Palico got approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to be the first company able to facilitate end-to-end LP secondaries transactions."},
{"category": "Security", "title": "Russian government hackers found using exploits made by spyware companies NSO and Intellexa", "date": "2024-08-29", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/29/russian-government-hackers-found-using-exploits-made-by-spyware-companies-nso-and-intellexa/", "content": "Google says it has evidence that Russian government hackers are using exploits that are “identical or strikingly similar” to those previously made by spyware makers Intellexa and NSO Group. In a blog post on Thursday , Google said it is not sure how the Russian government acquired the exploits, but said this is an example of how exploits developed by spyware makers can end up in the hands of “dangerous threat actors.” In this case, Google says the threat actors are APT29, a group of hackers widely attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or the SVR. APT29 is a highly capable group of hackers, known for its long-running and persistent campaigns aimed at conducting espionage and data theft against a range of targets, including tech giants Microsoft and SolarWinds, as well as foreign governments. Google said it found the hidden exploit code embedded on Mongolian government websites between November 2023 and July 2024. During this time, anyone who visited these sites using an iPhone or Android device could have had their phone hacked and data stolen, including passwords, in what is known as a “watering hole” attack. The exploits took advantage of vulnerabilities in the iPhone’s Safari browser and Google Chrome on Android that had already been fixed at the time of the suspected Russian campaign. Still, those exploits nevertheless could be effective in compromising unpatched devices. According to the blog post, the exploit targeting iPhones and iPads was designed to steal user account cookies stored in Safari specifically across a range of online email providers that host the personal and work accounts of the Mongolian government. The attackers could use the stolen cookies to then access those government accounts. Google said the campaign aimed at targeting Android devices used two separate exploits together to steal user cookies stored in the Chrome browser. Google security researcher Clement Lecigne, who authored the blog post, told TechCrunch that it is not known for certain who the Russian government hackers were targeting in this campaign. “But based on where the exploit was hosted and who would normally visit these sites, we believe that Mongolian government employees were a likely target,” he said. Lecigne, who works for Google’s Threat Analysis Group, the security research unit that investigates government-backed cyber threats, said Google is linking the reuse of the code to Russia because the researchers previously observed the same cookie-stealing code used by APT29 during an earlier campaign in 2021 . A key question remains: How did the Russian government hackers obtain the exploit code to begin with? Google said both iterations of the watering hole campaign targeting the Mongolian government used code resembling or matching exploits from Intellexa and NSO Group. These two companies are known for developing exploits capable of delivering spyware that can compromise fully patched iPhones and Android phones. Google said the exploit code used in the watering hole attack targeting Chrome users on Android shared a “very similar trigger” with an exploit developed earlier by NSO Group. In the case of the exploit targeting iPhones and iPads, Google said the code used the “exact same trigger as the exploit used by Intellexa,” which Google said strongly suggested that the exploit authors or providers “are the same.” When asked by TechCrunch about the reuse of exploit code, Lecigne said: “We do not believe the actor recreated the exploit,” ruling out the likelihood that the exploit was independently discovered by the Russian hackers. “There are multiple possibilities as to how they could have acquired the same exploit, including purchasing it after it was patched or stealing a copy of the exploit from another customer,” said Lecigne. NSO Group did not respond to TechCrunch’s inquiry prior to publication. In a statement provided after publication, NSO spokesperson Gil Lainer said: “NSO does not sell its products to Russia. Our technologies are sold exclusively to vetted U.S. & Israel-allied intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Our systems and technologies are highly secure and are continuously monitored to detect and neutralize external threats.” TechCrunch contacted the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC and Mongolia’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York for comment, but did not hear back by press time. Intellexa could not be reached for comment. Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer did not respond to a request for comment. Google said users should “apply patches quickly” and keep software up-to-date to help prevent malicious cyberattacks. According to Lecigne, iPhone and iPad users with the high-security feature Lockdown Mode switched on were not affected even when running a vulnerable software version.

IBM and Intel on Thursday said IBM Cloud will begin offering Gaudi 3 to customers early next year. The chip’s accelerators will be available for both hybrid and on-premise environments, and IBM says it plans to enable support for Gaudi 3 within its Watsonx AI and data platform. “Unlocking the full potential of AI requires an open and collaborative ecosystem that provides customers with choice and accessible solutions,” Justin Hotard, general manager of Intel’s data center and AI division, said in a statement. “By integrating Gaudi 3 AI accelerators and Xeon CPUs with IBM Cloud, we are creating new AI capabilities and meeting the demand for affordable, secure, and innovative AI computing solutions.” Gaudi 3, unveiled in December 2023, was meant to be Intel’s answer to AI chips from rivals Nvidia and AMD. It’s the end of the line for the Gaudi series of accelerators Intel got through its $2 billion acquisition of Habana Labs in 2019. Intel earlier this year showed off Gaudi 3 reference designs that partners like Lenovo, Dell, HPE and Super Micro could use in servers. The designs include a new form of Ethernet connectivity designed to compete with Nvidia’s InfiniBand connectivity technology. They also pair Gaudi 3 chips with Intel’s Xeon 6 processor series. But Gaudi 3 arrived at a precarious time for Intel, which has been strongly disadvantaged by Nvidia’s incumbency. In April, Intel said that it expected to generate revenue of $500 million from Gaudi 3 in 2024 — a paltry sum compared to the $4.5 billion AMD expects to rake in from sales of its Instinct MI300-series GPUs, and the $40 billion Nvidia expects from its data center business. Gaudi 3 delivers impressively high performance on the dollar, early benchmarks show , but bringing on board customers who already have strong relationships with Nvidia is presenting a challenge. In July, Intel CTO Greg Lavender optimistically said that the company could take second place in the AI chip market behind Nvidia. A month later, after posting a $1.6 billion loss for Q2, Intel said that it would eliminate 15,000 jobs and aggressively cut costs to save $10 billion in 2025. To make a bad situation worse for Intel, Nvidia intends to ramp up production of its next-generation AI chip, Blackwell, in Q4 after a brief manufacturing delay. Blackwell will offer up to four times the performance of the H100, the chip Gaudi 3 compares favorably against. Intel has made a point of not providing comparisons with Blackwell, saying that it can’t until Blackwell chips are publicly available."},

The company announced that parents will soon be able to approve age-appropriate worlds they’d like their preteens (aged 10 to 12) to experience, including hanging out in The Space Station , exploring The Aquarium and playing the Spy School racing game. Preteens can either request which world they’d like to access, or parents can go through the list and select specific ones to grant permission. Meta has also implemented additional safety measures that aim to ensure kids are protected. For instance, there is a new rating system — 10+, 13+ or 18+ — that signals which VR world is appropriate for younger users. This allows parents to approve all 10+ rated worlds at once, making 18+ worlds no longer visible to preteens. Also, there are no follower suggestions, and the preteens’ status and visibility settings are set to show as “offline” to others by default — unless parents manually enable them. Additionally, the “ Personal Boundary ” setting is permanently on, which gives avatars a bubble with a radius of two virtual feet, preventing people from coming too close to them. The announcement follows Meta adding the ability for parents to individually approve contacts that their child can chat with and invite to join them in VR experiences. Another recent update prompts anyone with a Meta Quest 2 or 3 headset to re-enter their birthday before using the device. Parent-managed accounts for preteens have been available since June 2023. Despite these new safety measures, some parents and guardians will likely still have doubts that Meta will protect their children, given the numerous accusations that the company fails to keep the age group safe on its platforms. Earlier this year , Meta was caught purposely promoting its messaging platforms to underage users even though it was aware of the inappropriate content exchanged between adults and kids, as per internal documents used in a lawsuit filed by the New Mexico Department of Justice. Another lawsuit filed by 42 U.S. state attorneys accuses Meta of intentionally designing its products to attract children, which negatively impacts their mental well-being."},

A new social network by a duo of Oxford PhDs is working on an app to let you add friends to a photo in a more memeable and fun way. Vybe is a mobile app that lets you upload a selfie and put your face in any picture or an existing template. It also swaps faces of you and your friends in a picture with multiple people. The tools also change the skin tone of the person in the template based on your skin tone so there is no mismatch between one’s face and body. Users can see photos created by their friends in a feed and upload their own templates too. The startup thinks that this will nudge more people to create content on the platform. Vybe said it has more than 100,000 user-generated templates, with the number growing quickly because it requires little effort to create a template. The company has built a social network around this to encourage people to connect more. While this is the core proposition now, the startup wants to build more photo- and video-related tools combining social, AR and generative AI. Vybe has raised $4.75 million in seed funding in a round led by Stellation Capital with support from Scribble Ventures, Coalition Operators, Neo and Blueprint FTC. Individuals like NFL player Kelvin Beachum, investor Ali Partovi, and OpenAI’s Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also contributed to the round. The company was founded by Mandela Patrick and Arnab Ghosh, who went to work at Meta and Snap, respectively. Patrick’s research focused on multi-modal AI video and image understanding. Later, he worked on core AI algorithms for Instagram Reels. Meanwhile, Ghosh researched generative models for image rendering. He worked at Snap on launching gen AI features like Bitmoji background. The co-founders said that they wanted to build a social product that has a network effect value. They also believe that there is value in creating a one-click tool for actions — such as placing faces of you and your friends in a photo — that used to require a long time. “When I was at Snap, I saw how little details can make a difference in adoption. While Photoshop was available for years, Snap allowed users to have different experiences with Lenses at a larger scale,” Ghosh said. While face-swapping apps such as Reface already exist, the Vybe co-founders hope that the ease of creating templates and users remixing them will create a network. “If you think about successful social products, they had a marquee format. For example, in Snapchat it was disappearing messages, and we think AI-powered photos with your friends is that format for us,” Patrick said. The company is exploring brand partnerships, ads and subscription revenue streams. It is also gearing up to launch features like video and animation support in the app. Peter Boyce II, the founder of Stellation Capital, believes that the founders have a deep level of depth and interest in AI, which will help them figure out the platform better. He thinks that the product being simple and frictionless to use will help Vybe in becoming a hit. “When all the technology they have worked with fades into the background, what is left is a simple, easy, and fun way to engage with different folks. And that for me is ingredients for something that become mainstream,” he told TechCrunch. BeReal, which banked on a format of nudging people to share in real time when they got a notification, faced issues when it came to maintaining growth and generating revenue . The company was eventually acquired by the French mobile apps and games publisher Voodoo . Vybe co-founders and investors believe that the company will succeed because it wants to create more formats and involve users in the creation process. But they emphasized that it’s important not to create behavior that creates fatigue amongst users. The app is available for download on iOS and Android ."},

Ask me how I know. The outage resulting from the recent hack has not, fortunately, caused planes to fall out of the sky or Air Traffic Control to double-book a runway. Those resources, run by the feds, are considerably more locked down. Rather than catastrophe, what we have now — and for the foreseeable future, since authorities have offered no timeline for restoration — is an object lesson in why we have rules about where we put our eggs. For my part, I found out on Sunday when — and I hesitate even to mention it, because no one seems to know about this miraculous service — I went to reserve my place in the security line via the SEA Spot Saver. The service was offline, and throwing the kind of error that you don’t have to be a sysadmin to know means deeper problems. If I had been a good reporter and read my own publication over the weekend, I would have known this was the result of, among other things, the entire user-facing DNS configuration of the Port’s web architecture being totally cooked. (The Spot Saver site is still offline, but the function has been resuscitated by Clear for now .) Luckily I was not checking a bag and security was light, possibly due to a jackknifed semi blocking all southbound traffic on I-5. At the airport, the large screens one would ordinarily loiter under to find one’s flight were ominously dark. But considering the endless construction at Sea-Tac, I chalked this up to electrical work. It was only at the “S” gates that the extent of the problem became clear. Every screen in the area was dark; the TVs above the waiting areas, the multi-display arrays directing travelers to gates, the monitors of the gate agents and the gate info displays themselves. Though my boarding pass had directed me to a gate, there was no way to be sure that was the correct one, so I checked with the agents there. They confirmed it, and I asked about the hack. “It definitely is a bit of a… show,” the airline agents agreed, politely eliding the same part of the word I had. All airport systems shared by multiple airlines were down. Baggage handling, they said, was getting the worst of it. The agents were (tell no one!) ignoring their own baggage size rules and didn’t bother collecting “volunteers” to gate-check bags and speed up boarding. Inter-airline communications were labored. The gate desk was mostly offline, I was told, as it’s a shared system between Alaska, Delta and anyone else who comes to the “S” gates. The gate was unable to display the flight number, boarding groups or any delays — a half-hour for my flight — except over the public address system — which was extremely competitive due to the need to constantly repeat current gate numbers. Nearby, one gate had paper signs announcing the flight that had last departed, though that was obviously hours earlier. (Sea-Tac airport spokesperson Perry Cooper told me in an email that my experience was “not typical of the rest of the airport.”) The tablets for checking people in were working, “but limited,” the agents said. Changing flights or seats was not happening. (“I think maybe I got upgraded to first,” I ventured hopefully, but they just shooed me away.) In situations where the digital infrastructure crashes, it can happen that those who cling to analog resources look smart rather than quaint. Not so today. As I waited, every few minutes someone would walk up to the gate with a paper ticket telling them this was where they departed. Some were lucky enough to be told it was just a few steps away, while one unfortunate soul was redirected all the way to the “N” gates — the polar opposite, as you may imagine, of the “S” gates. The solution, as proffered by gate agents and paper signs taped to blank displays alike, was to use the app. But it’s precisely because of problems like this week’s that no one can ever really trust “the app,” because “the app” is as likely to get the hacker treatment as the rest of the Port. What was extraordinary was that a suspected malicious hacker was able to tank so many systems in one go. We don’t have to expect that the baggage direction, gate guidance and security handling can’t be completely siloed and separate. This is an airport, not a nuclear power plant. Yet at the same time it seems wrong that the resilience of the system is so lacking. Sure, the airport intranet might go down — but the full-on public-facing website? Baggage routing and gate updates, too? All on the same network? We’ve understood the necessity of breaking apart critical systems for centuries, and have built it into our power and network infrastructure so that when one person runs two hairdryers at the same time, it doesn’t knock out the whole neighborhood. I’m not complaining because I was inconvenienced. To be honest, this airport trip was no better or worse for me personally than any other. But I saw countless people being put out due to what amounts to badly secured, probably woefully understaffed government IT infrastructure. When the feds talk about refurbishing critical infrastructure, this is what they’re talking about. Yes, it’s also the ’80s-era computer running on COBOL that controls the traffic lights, dams or missile silos. But it’s events like this — not so much the recent CrowdStrike outage debacle , actually — that really show the soft, vulnerable underbelly of local and national systems. Critical infrastructure, like airports, have a disturbingly large attack surface that have comparatively few resources dedicated to their upkeep. It’s not that an airport isn’t as valuable of a target as, say, a financial institution or a data broker, but that’s changing. Ransomware, for instance, has proven highly profitable and easy to automate, and AI (you knew it had to figure somewhere) is supercharging credential theft via spear-phishing operations. All this to say that the trend of unlikely targets — schools, libraries and hospitals — being held to ransom is only going to intensify — but these attacks can be prevented, just as they can in private industry where they have expected them for decades. Anyone traveling through Sea-Tac should definitely budget a bit more time to get through the airport and install the relevant apps. State and city authorities are doing their best to keep everyone informed on this crisis page ."},

On Thursday, Codeium said it closed a $150 million Series C round led by General Catalyst that values the company at $1.25 billion post-money. The round, which also saw participation from existing investors Kleiner Perkins and Greenoaks, brings the company’s total funding raised to nearly a quarter-billion dollars ($243 million) a mere three years since its launch. Codeium’s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, told TechCrunch that Codeium hasn’t even touched the $65 million Series B tranche it raised in January yet. Back then, just eight months ago, Codeium was valued at half a billion dollars. “Even though we’ve barely made a dent in our existing funding, we believe that this injection of capital will allow us to significantly ramp up R&D and growth while making even larger strategic bets,” he said. Codeium was founded in 2021 by Mohan and his childhood friend and fellow MIT grad, Douglas Chen. Prior to Codeium, Chen was at Meta, where he helped to build software tools for VR headsets like the Oculus Quest. Mohan was a tech lead at Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup, responsible for managing the autonomy infrastructure team. The startup began as a radically different company called Exafunction , focused on GPU optimization and virtualization for AI workloads. But in 2022, Mohan and Chen sensed a bigger opportunity in generative coding and decided to rebrand — and pivot. “Despite the influx of generative AI tools, developers are still struggling with time-consuming coding tasks,” Mohan said. “Many of the AI-driven solutions provide generic code snippets that require significant manual work to integrate and secure within existing codebases. That’s where our AI coding assistance comes in.” Codeium’s platform, powered by generative AI models trained on public code, serves up suggestions in the context of an app’s entire codebase. It supports around 70 programming languages and integrates with a number of popular development environments, including Microsoft Visual Studio and JetBrains. To attract devs away from Copilot and other rivals, Codeium has released a generous free tier to start. The strategy seems to have worked: Today, the startup has more than 700,000 users and over 1,000 enterprise customers, including Anduril, Zillow and Dell. Quentin Clark, managing director at General Catalyst, implied that Codeium won some of its larger contracts by embracing a steadfastly client-centric approach to product research. “The team’s approach has always been to follow its customers, leading the company to build solutions on their terms — deployable in any environment and supporting more languages than anyone else,” Clark said in a statement. “What Codeium has created isn’t just a demo, an announcement, or an idea — this is a fully scaling business, with large enterprises adopting the product across their entire organizations.” Businesses are often wary of exposing proprietary code to a third party — for instance, Apple reportedly banned staff from using Copilot last year, citing concerns about confidential data leakage. To attempt to allay such fears, Codeium began offering a self-hosted installation option alongside its standard software-as-a-service plan. Companies can now deploy Codeium’s service on their own hardware if they wish. Or they can adopt a hybrid setup, keeping their data on their own devices while using Codeium’s servers for computing needs. There’s always some risk involved in data transfers to the cloud, but Mohan claimed that Codeium leverages strong encryption. “We never train our proprietary generative autocomplete model on user data, never sell data and ensure all data transmission is encrypted,” he added. Codeium has also taken steps to remove “non-permissively” licensed code (e.g., code under copyright) from the datasets it used to train its AI models. Some code-generating tools trained using restrictively licensed or copyrighted code have been shown to regurgitate that code when prompted in a certain way, posing a liability risk (i.e., developers that incorporate the code could be sued). Mohan said that’s not the case with Codeium, thanks to its training data prep and filtering approach. “We also remove any remaining data that looks similar to code that is explicitly non-permissively licensed just in case other people copied code without providing the proper attribution and licensing,” he added. “On top of this, we have state-of-the-art, post-generation attribution filtering and logging in the case that these large probabilistic models produce code that is similar to public code, whether permissively or non-permissively licensed.” But what about hallucinations ? Most AI coding tools are notorious for making stuff up, which can be quite destructive in an enterprise environment. An analysis by developer tooling startup GitClear found that generative AI tools have resulted in more mistaken code being pushed to codebases over the past few years. And a Purdue study found that over half the answers that OpenAI’s ChatGPT gives to programming questions are incorrect. Security researchers have warned of the potential for such tools to amplify existing bugs in software. A recent survey from cybersecurity firm Snyk found that nine in ten developers worry about the broader security implications of using AI coding platforms. But Mohan claimed that Codeium’s supposedly superior, deep context-rich tech yields more trustworthy results than most. “Our context awareness engine is able to ground results in what is already existing in a user’s codebase, leading to suggestions with fewer hallucinations and more adherence to existing syntax, semantics and standards,” he said. Whether benchmarks back that up or not, Codeium’s sales pitch seems to be resonating with the right execs: Revenue hit eight figures this year. Mohan said the 80-person, Mountain View-based startup plans to expand headcount to 120 by 2025 as it aims to make a bigger dent in a market with formidable competitors like Tabnine , Anysphere and Poolside . Catching up to Copilot, which had over 1.8 million paying users as of April, probably isn’t in the cards for Codeium — at least not imminently. It doesn’t have to be. As Mohan rightly noted, given the widespread adoption of AI coding tools among developers (despite their reservations), even a small slice of the nascent segment is bound to be lucrative. Polaris Research projects that the AI code tools market will be worth $27.17 billion by 2032. “An overabundance of hype is a challenge the industry faces,” Mohan said. “This will make it harder for every company to truly convince end users that they are at the forefront of possibility. But we believe that truth-seeking and realistic AI companies like Codeium will eventually cut through this noise.”"},

However, the agri-input market, which provides inputs for the sector — be it seeds, pesticides, herbicides or cultivation and harvesting tools — largely relies on traditional channels, including local offline marketplaces. The sector lacks a robust supply chain, and logistics are complicated in remote geographies where most farmers are located. Additionally, India’s agri-inputs landscape is different from that of the U.S. and Europe due to its fragmented market structure, diversified demand and seasonal nature of crops. Agrim aims to address all these discrepancies by building a just-in-time supply chain to help agri-input retailers buy inputs from a specific manufacturer. The marketplace helps take the order to the manufacturing warehouse the moment it comes from a retailer, co-founder Mukul Garg said in an exclusive interview. Garg, a second-time entrepreneur who co-founded the travel app Tripigator in 2013, founded Agrim along with Avi Jain in April 2020. He has also headed products and growth at logistics company BlackBuck and was responsible for building its on-demand trucking marketplace. Agrim deals with retailers and manufacturers that have not used an e-commerce platform before, offering a minimalistic user interface along with the ability to let retailers set the pricing. The portal also includes a custom-designed order management system that allocates a manufacturer to every order it gets and ensures the pickup and delivery timelines are matched. Further, the startup works with multiple third-party logistics service providers to handle last-mile delivery. The startup currently offers its catalog in four categories: seeds, agrochemicals, nutrition and tools. Each category also includes subcategories (600 subcategories in total), such as herbicides, fungicides and pesticides for crop protection, and 70 subcategories in the equipment segment, including hand tools and motor-operated tools. Agrim uses a pricing intelligence model to set appropriate prices for products it gets from manufacturers. There are system algorithms to set prices based on factors including demand and supply to provide dynamic pricing on its platform. The startup takes anywhere between 10% to 60-70% of margins, Garg said, after giving a certain price to the manufacturer. Agrim also offers lending to retailers, who usually do not get access to credit through traditional channels, and about 10% of its retail base currently uses that credit offering, Garg told TechCrunch. It hopes to grow that business to 30% of retailers in the next few years, in part by extending the credit period from 30 days to up to 45 days. Now, the four-year-old company has raised $17.3 million in a new funding round led by Asia Impact. It plans to use its fresh funding to expand its catalog of agri-inputs from over 30,000 items to 150,000 in the next three years, and to expand to southern and western parts of India, including Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some parts of Maharashtra, Garg told TechCrunch. Similarly, the startup plans to expand its catalog by adding two new categories: animal feed covering cattle, fish and shrimp feed and testing out irrigation equipment. Agrim also seeks to enter into the market of private-label agri-inputs within the next six months in order to help farmers get inputs at retail prices instead of paying a premium. “We are trying to democratize as a platform,” said Garg. “We are seeing a lot of demand and supply mismatches. So with private labels, we want to solve for unmet demand or supply.” Agrim claims a base of 1,200 manufacturers and 25,000 retailers serving 15 million farmers. The startup generated more than $36 million in the last financial year and is on the annual revenue run rate of nearly $60 million. The all-equity Series B round also included participation from existing investors Accion Venture Lab, India Quotient, Kalaari and Omnivore."}
